<p>Hello readers!
Today’s post is about how I have been coping with all the craziness of the pandemic, racism, police brutality and overall bad news. In addition to talking with your loved ones and those you seek out for support, music can also be a form of relief. I listen to music both to come to terms with reality and to feel better. That’s how this playlist is set up. It moves through 10 songs from a place of anger to emotions in between to a place of hope.</p>

<p>First up we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHhND-BkWdk" target="_blank" title="">All Alone </a>by Gorillaz featuring Roots Manuva. During this time it can easily feel like you’re all alone. Please, text or call your family and friends, you are never really alone, but people cannot read your mind. No one will know you need support if you don’t ask for it. This song is rumored to be about Manuva’s outlook on the world. The pacing of the beginning really makes you feel the sadness, the dissapointment the plea to again be alright.</p>

<p>Next is  we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=votgfrZpq7Q&amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&amp;index=73" target="_blank" title="">Breathe You In</a> by Grace The Enemy. This band’s lead is a woman with a delicious scream and a lovely singing voice. The lyrics call out as if you are searching for validation, for redemption:</p>

<p><em>“Holding on to this dream we’ve made</em></p>

<p><em>I’m less if not crumbling,</em></p>

<p><em>I know my mind won’t be the same</em></p>

<p><em>As long as we remain undying</em></p>

<p><em>Breathe you in</em></p>

<p><em>Overwhelmed, As I</em></p>

<p><em>Breathe you in</em></p>

<p><em>Take my hand</em></p>

<p><em>Show me life as I</em></p>

<p><em>Breathe you in</em></p>

<p><em>Breathe you in!”</em></p>

<p>It is a call to perseverance, to keep going. To breathe in the good, and to remain undying in your stride, in your fight for something higher, something better.</p>

<p>Then we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBjQ9tuuTJQ&amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&amp;index=69" target="_blank" title="">The Pretender</a> by Foo Fighters. I personally love this song and play it all year round. It gets me hyped up to do anything. The better part of my adult life has felt like a fight. Fighting to survive, fighting to drag myself out of poverty, fighting to keep food on the table and a roof over my own head. Finding this song a few years ago was very uplifting, whenever I need the push to get back on my feet, I remember the lyrics:</p>

<p><em>What if I say I’m not like the others?</em></p>

<p><em>What if I say I’m not just another one of your plays?</em></p>

<p><em>You’re the pretender</em></p>

<p><em>What if I say that I’ll never surrender?”</em></p>

<p>The idea that I’m somehow special, “not like the others”. The idea that I’ll never surrender, I’ll always keep going. Not falling into the “pretender’s” play. That notion is very powerful, standing in the face of opposition and refusing to bow down. There has been a lot of discourse online about what they meant by pretender. For me personally, the pretender is my depression. She wants to lie around all day pretending I can waste away. I pretend when I am depressed that my life isn’t worth living, but it always has been and will continue to be. This song gives me the stength to fight another day, to see my worth, and to keep growing.</p>

<p>Segueing into something lighter, next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS6sDhqVROs" target="_blank" title="">Something’s Gotta Give</a> by All Time Low. Despite the bands name the music they make can be very relatable and even uplifting. I have been fed up with the state America is in. In the context of the struggle the Black community is facing the lyrics fit perfectly:</p>

<p><em>“Wake me up, say enough is enough,</em></p>

<p><em>I’m dying to live, something’s gotta give.</em></p>

<p><em>Pull me out of this sinking town,</em></p>

<p><em>I’m dying to live, something’s gotta give!”</em></p>

<p>The first lyric is a plea, and I feel like I have been trying to “wake people up” to the truth. When I see those who are misguided it almost feels like they are asking me to enlighten them. They probably aren’t, but I can’t seem to stop myself from correcting misinformation. I want to wake people up to the truth of the racist system we are governed by, the truth of white supremacy around every corner, the truth that we all live on stolen indigenous land. Too many turn a blind eye to people struggling, but I will no longer blink in the face of ignorance. We are dying to live to our full potential; literally being killed by both law enforcement and the bias within the system and something does have to give, something has to change.</p>

<p>Next is another throwback <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XleOkGsYgO8&amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&amp;index=7" target="_blank" title="">Move Along</a> by All American Rejects. “Move Along” is some of the best advice I have recieved. Sometimes it’s easy to succumb to our emotions, or the way we feel about situations in our lives. If you shorten transition time (idea I read from Peter Bergman) and choose to look forward and keep going it will be easier to get through your day to day. As the song says:</p>

<p><em>“Speak to me!</em></p>

<p><em>When all you got to keep is strong</em></p>

<p><em>Move along, move along like I know you do</em></p>

<p><em>And even when your hope is gone</em></p>

<p><em>Move along, move along just to make it through</em></p>

<p><em>Move along</em></p>

<p><em>Move along”</em></p>

<p>Sometimes all you have is movement, moving into the next moment. I try to make it better than the last, the small steps add up to a significant recognizable change.</p>

<p>Next up is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_O_T6Aq85E&amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&amp;index=44&amp;t=0s" target="_blank" title="">Snap Out Of It</a> by The Arctic Monkeys. Too often I find myself stuck in a rut. Now that all this extra time is available to us it can be so easy to fall victim to spending a significant amount of times on our phones, or on social media. Many times a week I will find I am glued to facebook and twitter needing to stay in the know of the state of this country given all the protests and police brutality they are rallying against. Sometimes you need to snap out of it for your own mental health. Remember to draw the line for your own well being.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSivlaSVk1k&amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&amp;index=17" target="_blank" title="">We Got The Power</a> by Gorillaz. I was trying really hard to not repeat artists on this playlist, but this song is exactly what this playlist needs. At the end of the day through all the terrible things happening in the world, we have power. The chorus goes:</p>

<p><em>“We got the power to be loving each other, no matter what happens</em>
<em>We’ve got the power to do that</em>
<em>On a le pouvoir de s’aimer, okay?</em>
<em>We got the power to be ringing the great bell out there above us</em>
<em>We got the power for that</em>
<em>We got the power to do that”</em></p>

<p>We as humans can choose to feel unity. I urge you reader, when it is safe to go out once again, get to know your community. Your neighbors, the local shop owners, the people in your immediate area. You are even more fortunate if your town has a community center, check out local events. We see these racists online and ask how they can be so hateful and ignorant. It is because they aren’t exposed to people who don’t look like them. They make assumptions and don’t fact check their news. They follow an orange menace who spews hate, bigotry and xenophobia. Spending time with people in your community is a great way to make friends and feel empathy for others. We have always had the power to keep loving each other. Be the example you want to see in the world.</p>

<p>Lastly we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzQWCeguH30" target="_blank" title="">Crystal Clear</a> by Hayley Williams. This one is fairly new, it is about seeing things as they truly are and as Williams says in the echoing chorus, much like a mantra:</p>

<p><em>“Crystal Clear, I won’t give into the fear.”</em></p>

<p>In these scary, troubling times it is important to look at the situation without fear, but rather objectivity. Giving into fear will only make your decisions erractic and possibly dangerous. Seeing things in new light can be incredibly liberating. The second I started looking at Quarantine as a detriment I lost all power in the situation. I now see this just is, and I need to make the best of it and have been attempting to do so.</p>
