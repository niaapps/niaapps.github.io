<p>Hello my readers, hoping you are keeping hope amid these unpredictable times.</p>

<p>Today is my birthday. It is also <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breonna-taylor-fbi-investigation-shooting-louisville-police/" target="_blank" title="">Breonna </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Breonna_Taylor" target="_blank" title="">Taylor’s</a> birthday. Instead of talking about me I would like to talk about her story. Breonna would have turned 27 today. She was an essential worker, an EMT. She was a University of Kentucky graduate and steadily pursuing her career in the medical field. She was serving her community and her country by working during a  pandemic. That in itself is admirable,  the bravery it takes to work during the spread of a deadly virus should  not be overlooked. In an <a href="" target="_blank" title="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869930040/as-the-nation-chants-her-name-breonna-taylors-family-grieves-a-life-robbed">NPR</a> interview released yesterday family and friends talked about her and her life. How she said she would make a name for herself. I want that to sink in. She was very young and had her whole life ahead of her.</p>

<p>Her life was taken, family described the loss as feeling they were robbed. The incident occurred past midnight on March 13th, 2020. We know now that three cops in plain clothes entered her home on a no-knock warrant. Kenneth Walker, Breonna’s boyfriend said that after hearing loud bangs on the door, Breonna repeatedly asked <em>“Who is it?”</em> with no response. Walker, a licensed gun owner then armed himself due to lack of response. Police used a battery ram to enter the apartment. Walker shoots first, logically assuming these men are burglars as they did not identify themselves. He then shot one robber in the leg. Officers responded by opening fire of <em>more than 20 rounds</em>, shooting Breonna at least <strong><em>8 times</em></strong>, ending her life. Kenneth was arrested at the time, but has since had all <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/trending/charges-dropped-against-breonna-taylors-boyfriend-police-chief-retires-fbi-joins-probe/MDUWBEGADNHSVKIWVV3G42BZLA/" target="_blank" title="">charges dropped</a> on grounds of self-defense. Breonna had an ex-boyfriend who was in custody for selling drugs, and suspected of shipping them to Breonna’s home. She had nothing to do with the drugs but the no knock warrant that a judge awarded was <em>based on this suspicion</em>. No drugs were found in the apartment. This negligence cost Breonna her life. Family and friends tell the truth, that she was not that type of person, who would risk the life she had for something as silly as drugs. It has been 84 days since her death. On May 21st the F.B.I. began an investigation but the three cops are still out there employed on the force.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-knock_warrant#cite_note-nyt19m-1 " target="_blank" title="">history</a> and use of no-knock warrants is all bad news. The number of no-knock raids has increased from 3,000 in 1981 to over 50,000 in 2005. From 2010 to 2016 31 civilians died at the hands of officers using a no-knock warrant and 81 civilians died during SWAT raids using no-knock warrants. More than half of civilians killed were a minority, 42% of them African American.</p>

<p>It is heartbreaking to hear how a woman full of so much life and promise is no longer with us. Police brutality has been on the rise in the US. From 2013-2019, police in Kentucky killed <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/" target="_blank" title=""><em>122 people</em>.</a> Black people are <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/" target="_blank" title=""><em>three times</em></a> more likely to be killed by police than White people.</p>

<p>If you read my last <a href="https://niaapps.github.io/niaapps-blog/updates-personal/2020/05/31/Black-Lives-Matter.html" target="_blank" title="">post</a> you may recall that Black people are also three times as more likely to die from the COVID-19. Breonna was risking the last of her days in more ways than one. If you are born Black it should not warrant suspicion, the color of your skin should not be a death sentence. This injustice has not gone unnoticed. Protests are happening to garner support and awareness for Ms. Taylor. We need to continue putting pressure on the Louisville Metro Police Department to arrest Myles Cosgrove, Brett Hankison and Jonathan Mattingly. Recently we saw how the same fight for accountability can have positive results as the degree of murder in the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/3-more-minneapolis-officers-charged-george-floyd-death-derek-chauvin-n1222796" target="_blank" title="">George Floyd</a> case was raised as well as the arrest of other complicit officers. We need the same swift action for Breonna Taylor.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
