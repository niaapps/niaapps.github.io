<p>Hey readers.
Today I am revisiting a topic I’ve <a href="https://niaapps.github.io/niaapps-blog/updates-personal/2019/04/12/growing-pains.html" target="_blank" title="Growing Pains blog post">already written about</a>: growing.</p>

<p>I’m sure many will agree, during this pandemic we’ve all been forced to grow in so many different ways. If you are like me and have had a mental illness before, things like depression, anxiety, or have to tackle things like anger issues, being stuck inside probably didn’t help the situation. You are not alone in this struggle of having your problems be exacerbated by Covid-19. As we saw in the beginning <a href="https://time.com/5928539/domestic-violence-covid-19/" target="_blank" title="TIME article about the rise of domestic violence during covid">domestic</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764221992826" target="_blank" title="Published study about Initimate Partner Violence during Covid">abuse</a> cases (majority of victims being women) shot up because we were all forced inside (meaning victims had less time away from their abusers daily). Tons of new hate crimes arose towards the Asian American community, as well as the sustained abuse against the Black community with police brutality, and growing tension towards immigrants from our southern border. All around since this pandemic began a lot of things have changed, creating new problems for us as well as making already existing problems worse. These high-stress situations on top of the advent of an easily transmissible virus is more than our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=q8rrewfLDuU" target="_blank" title="Video about how stress from covid is affecting our brains and bodies">brains were ever meant to handle.</a> Due to this we have all been forced to grow to accommodate whatever new situation we are in. Today I’ll be writing about my experience and how I have grown during this challenging time, but I would love to start a greater conversation about collectively how the world has grown through this time, so feel free to comment your own experience.</p>

<p>This past summer I have had a few instances where I’ve met someone new and was told I am “intimidating”. Which boggled me because I know much work I have done to get to this point, and am just doing me. The fact that anyone would see me as having my shit together is astounding, because I know how far it took to get me here. As mentioned above in the past I have been diagnosed with both depression and anxiety. I also have trouble with controlling my anger. When I am stressed I do not have a lot of mental clarity. I tunnel vision myself into whatever it is I am focused on, good or bad when stressed. I have trouble asking for help, and at the beginning of this pandemic I did not love myself nearly as much as I do today. It probably is taboo to throw all my problems out there, but I say these things so that I can accurately depict how much I have changed since the pandemic began. These are all things or areas I have had to work on, day in and day out. Despite all of it I can still be the bubbly positive person I am because I choose to do the work.</p>

<p>The one thing that helped me in every area, a habit I started but did not go as deeply into since my last <a href="https://niaapps.github.io/niaapps-blog/updates-personal/2019/04/12/growing-pains.html" target="_blank" title="Growing Pains blog post">post</a>.</p>

<p>The area where I needed the most growth was self-love. Without self-love you let yourself stay in situations you shouldn’t, maybe out of comfort, or apathy.  Without self-love all the other issues I outline before were that much harder on me, because I lacked compassion for myself. Treating yourself with kindness, giving yourself space to just be on your hardest days was necessary for me to even begin changing for the better. For me self-love began with simply looking in the mirror every day and saying “I love you and _.” and filling the blank with something relevant to that day. I also an exercise, where I wrote a list titled “Things I like about myself” and wrote any and everything filling a page of loose-leaf. Then at the end you cross out “Like”, replacing it with “Love” and recite the list in a mirror. Then I meditated, doing guided meditations on treating yourself with compassion, but more on meditation later. I left the list out in a place I’d see it daily and would re-read it when I felt I needed a boost.</p>
