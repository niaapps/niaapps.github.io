<p>Hey readers.
Today I am revisiting a topic Iâ€™ve <a href="https://niaapps.github.io/niaapps-blog/updates-personal/2019/04/12/growing-pains.html" target="_blank" title="Growing Pains blog post">already written about</a>: growing.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m sure many will agree, during this pandemic weâ€™ve all been forced to grow in so many different ways. If you are like me and have had a mental illness before, things like depression, anxiety, or have to tackle things like anger issues, being stuck inside probably didnâ€™t help the situation. You are not alone in this struggle of having your problems be exacerbated by Covid-19. As we saw in the beginning <a href="https://time.com/5928539/domestic-violence-covid-19/" target="_blank" title="TIME article about the rise of domestic violence during covid">domestic</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764221992826" target="_blank" title="Published study about Initimate Partner Violence during Covid">abuse</a> cases (majority of victims being women) shot up because we were all forced inside (meaning victims had less time away from their abusers daily). Tons of new hate crimes arose towards the Asian American community, as well as the sustained abuse against the Black community with police brutality, and growing tension towards immigrants from our southern border. All around since this pandemic began a lot of things have changed, creating new problems for us as well as making already existing problems worse. These high-stress situations on top of the advent of an easily transmissible virus is more than our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=q8rrewfLDuU" target="_blank" title="Video about how stress from covid is affecting our brains and bodies">brains were ever meant to handle.</a> Due to this we have all been forced to grow to accommodate whatever new situation we are in.</p>
