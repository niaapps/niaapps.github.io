<p>Hey readers!</p>

<p>Today I am writing about a topic that everyone should care about. If you use the internet or social media daily, this one is for you!</p>
<div class="mouse-over">(Don't we all?)</div>

<p>Have you ever been on social media, minding your business, when suddenly an ad that is just a little <strong><em>too</em></strong> personal pops up on your feed?</p>

<p>{insert reel}</p>

<p>It is not fun! It feels like someone is watching over your shoulder. So today I am going to answer the question: <em>‚ÄúWhy and how does this happen?‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Internet privacy is how much of your personal information remains private when you are on the internet. This can include financial information, browsing history, and personal preferences. Internet privacy is also known as digital privacy or online privacy.</p>

<p>We are constantly sharing data about ourselves on platforms we use. Google uses your birthday to make sure you get age-appropriate ads. When you like a photo on Instagram it will suggest similar ads containing products connected to it. When you visit a website you are sharing data: your location through IP, your habits (how long you spend on a page, what you click on etc.). Similarly, search engines collect both of these in addition to search history and cookies.</p>

<p>Companies collect this data and create a ‚Äúprofile‚Äù on all of us to give them an idea on our preferences from social media to browsing, from shopping to political stances. Sometimes this data is sold to third parties, and sometimes it is used directly by the company, for say targeted ads.</p>

<p>¬†¬†¬†</p>
<h3 id="the-what">The ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù</h3>
<p>There are 3 types of ads I‚Äôd like to mention:</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="social-media-advertising">Social Media Advertising</h4>
  <p>These are ads within your chosen platform. These change based on your and your friends‚Äô actions within an app or platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="behavioral-advertising">Behavioral Advertising</h4>
  <p>Sites like Amazon will use your previous purchasing habits to find the perfect ad to go with the thing you previously bought.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="search-engine-advertising">Search Engine Advertising</h4>
  <p>Self explanatory, but ads are based on keywords that you type into search engines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>¬†¬†¬†</p>
<h3 id="the-how">The ‚ÄúHow‚Äù</h3>
<p>There are some misconceptions about the ‚Äúhow‚Äù. Companies cannot listen to you through your phone and then give you an ad for the thing you verbally said (The government is a different story, but I‚Äôll save that for another post.). Nonetheless, it feels <em>this</em> invasive when a targeted ad is shown.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs go over an example and breakdown each step. Pretend you are shopping for a reusable water bottle.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You go to a retail website like Walmart.com or Amazon.com and a cookie is created associated with your computer. This includes you, your personal data and your location.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you visit an article the next day (regardless if you purchased something or not) the article‚Äôs website reads your cookie data. Then you start to get ads related to the cookie, say, fitness equipment, or a water-soluble health drink.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paired with your search engine history, social media likes and dislikes and more help ads become more and more targeted.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is multi-platformed too, if different sites or apps are using the same ad provider, for ex, Google‚Äôs Ad sense. If you go on 5 different apps that all use the same ad provider you are likely to get ads from the same company, as the provider is drawing from the same pool of information each time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your internet browser, search engines and websites all store this information for as long as you let them, so be sure to clear your cookies and data when you need to. The downside to this is having to sign in manually, as the same data, like a saved user-name or password is also stored this way. Targeted ads that feel way too personal are the culmination of websites having a large amount of information on you. The right to be forgotten, or the right to internet privacy is something we should all care about especially  given that Trump signed into law a measure that <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/status-internet-privacy-legislation-state" target="_blank" title="ACLU article about Internet privacy">allows ISPs to </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-signs-measure-let-isps-sell-your-data-without-consent-n742316" target="_blank" title="NBC article about Trump's ISP measure">sell your data without consent</a> in April 2017.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, if you are on a social media site, your searches, data, and preferences can be used to draw up ads for your friends, or vice versa. If you have friends who are about the same age, or have some other similarity in data that an algorithm can make sense of, a targeted ad can be served. Companies are not listening to you, or reading your messages, but they are taking all of our combined information, piecing it together to serve ads that will make you cringe and feel watched.</p>

<p>¬†¬†¬†</p>
<h3 id="what-can-you-do">What can you do?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately the only way to 100% avoid the tracking is to go offline completely. In this digital age especially with the pandemic it is especially hard to do this. From companies that check your Facebook before hiring, to potential dates needing validation through Instagram that you are not a serial killer, going completely offline is not an option.</p>

<h4 id="here-are-some-things-that-you-can-do">Here are some things that you can do:</h4>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="use-an-ad-blocker-where-you-can">Use an ad blocker where you can</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>Online on my laptop I have an adblocker on all the time. The only time I get targeted ads is when on social media ads as discussed above. You can even find specific ad blockers for sites like youtube, and on your phone, work around apps that circumvent ads (ex: YoutubeVanced by XDA developers on Android). There are developers out there who also believe in the right to be forgotten, and the right to privacy, it just takes a little searching.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="use-private-browsing-mode">Use private browsing mode</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>All modern browsers have a private browsing mode which do not keep track of web history. If you are not going somewhere you‚Äôll likely need to revisit, private browsing is an option. Social media info and search history can still be tracked but taking this step cannot hurt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="clear-your-cookies-on-a-schedule">Clear your cookies on a schedule</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned before clearing your cookies can really help, but is a hassle, to have to log in again on all your daily sites. But if you find you get targeted ads say 2-3 months after clearing your cookies, you now know it takes about 2-3 months before the algorithm has gained enough info about you to do its job, and that is your schedule. It will vary from person to person as how much information we share varies, which leads me to my next point‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="share-less-of-your-info-online">Share less of your info online</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you need to geo tag that post? Does the world absolutely need to know what brand those shoes are? This tip is a little give and take. If you know anything about running social media accounts for the purpose of growth, you know that geotagging, hashtagging and more are all very important to outreach. But on your personal accounts you don‚Äôt have to share this information unless you want to. Do so at your own risk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="opt-out-and-lockdown-where-possible">Opt-out and lockdown where possible</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>You can say to ad companies you don‚Äôt want to be tracked <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN">here.</a>
Not all of them will honor it, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try.</p>

<p>On your social media sites you can limit the location data you share, and control specific ad settings. (I do so on Facebook and Instagram)</p>

<p>Thank you, and safe browsing to those who read this far.</p>
