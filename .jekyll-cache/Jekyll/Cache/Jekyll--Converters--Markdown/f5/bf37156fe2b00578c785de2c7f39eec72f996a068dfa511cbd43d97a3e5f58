<p>Hey there!!</p>

<p>I am nearly finished with my lapdesk.</p>

<p>I super glued foam like cut-outs to the back of it and covered with this cute fabric:</p>

<p>And then I also worked on the painting again on the opposite side before I had to get ready for my new internship, which Iâ€™ll tell you about in a bit.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m thinking I need to clean up the color a little bit and I may add some animal on the right cliff. But rn it already seems to have come together well. Iâ€™m really pleased with it.</p>

<p>So as I mentioned before. I actually not only have an internship now but a new job in general. I was unemployed when my last waitressing job was laying people off but now Iâ€™m back on track with 2!! The internship is a dream. Itâ€™s at this tech company called OpenX and I get to work on a phone app!! Which is exactly what I want to do in the field so itâ€™s Grade A experience. On a personal note, things in my life are just coming together, and Iâ€™m ready to put my best foot forward.</p>

<p>Till Next Time!</p>
