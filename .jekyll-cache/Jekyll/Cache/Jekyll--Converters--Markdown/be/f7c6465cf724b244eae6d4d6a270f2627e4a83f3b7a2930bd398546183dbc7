Hey Readers. I hope that all of you are safe where you are and that your families are well.</p>

<p>   I’m sure you all have been keeping up with the news. We have yet again failed Black people in this country [USA]. The death of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/us/george-floyd-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" title="Article about the life of Floyd">George </a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-worked-together.html" target="_blank" title="Article about the Murder of Floyd">Floyd</a> 6 days ago is another heartbreaking tragedy. He was accused of using a fake bill at a store on completely unfounded grounds. The incident ended with him begging for his life, because three cops were on top of him, one, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on his neck for <em>over 8 full minutes</em>. He was murdered for the color of his skin. Gruesomely two months before we saw this same story of Black lives being robbed happen to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kentucky-governor-calls-for-investigation-of-breonna-taylor-killing_n_5ebc625fc5b6cdefa7e8fb38" target="_blank" title="Article about Taylor's tragic death">Breonna Taylor</a> who had <strong><em>zero</em></strong>, literally nothing to do with the case the officers were actually investigating. Nonetheless her life was taken in the comfort of her own home. We only got a drop of decency from the department who released her partner Kenneth Walker, who was defending himself and Breonna from the officers invading their home. Then there is <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/05/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia-explainer.html" target="_blank">Ahmaud Arbery</a> who was killed, simply jogging in his own neighborhood while black. The hate crime went unpunished for nearly <a href="https://reason.com/2020/05/08/it-took-georgia-officials-2-months-to-arrest-and-charge-father-and-son-with-ahmaud-arberys-murder/" target="_blank"><em>2 full months</em></a>, his killers living their lives as if they hadn’t ended someone’s life prematurely because they could. The white supremacy complex so many people in this country subscribe to must come to an end.</p>

<p>   This plight for justice has always been something I have cared about. I am biracial, and I know we have a bad rap sometimes because some people don’t know how to act. (I’m looking at you <a href="https://twitter.com/lucky_Shanghai/status/1217664668434604032?s=20)" target="_blank" title="Beware, this is some clown shit.">Jeanie Reuter</a>) I am Black and I am Chinese. The thing is, I have privilege as a light-skinned person and I am doing my community a disservice if I don’t use it to uplift Black voices– which are too often brushed off, ignored, or crushed.</p>

<p>   When I was a teenager my dad had a close friend who lost his father. His father was a Black Vietnam War Veteran. He fell asleep on his life alert, an honest mistake. When he woke up, he called to let them know what had happened. Dispatch sent word, telling these cops that their services were no longer necessary at the scene. These white cops did not listen. They took matters into their own hands. After exchanging harsh words with our Veteran, who rightfully refused to let them into his home, they called him the n-word with hard r, entered the apartment, and tased and shot him, ultimately ending his life. I say his name, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Kenneth_Chamberlain_Sr" target="_blank" title="Wiki Page on Chamberlain">Kenneth </a><a href="https://www.bleausa.org/report-blasts-review-of-wppd-calls-justification-of-chamberlain-shooting-chilling/" target="_blank" title="Article about the incident">Chamberlain </a><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/prus-attorney-s-office-closes-investigation-death-kenneth-chamberlain" target="_blank" title="Closing Chamberlain's Investigation">Sr</a> just as I say the three I mentioned earlier because this senseless killing must stop. Officers must be held accountable. The Police lied on reports, saying Chamberlain was armed, and did not include the exchange where they called him the n-word. We later got <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/westchester-man-killed-cops-not-knife-lawyers-article-1.2850274" target="_blank" title="">DNA Proof</a> that Chamberlain was unarmed and after many battles in court got audio released to us, which is how we know the incident was racially charged. In 2012 a Grand Jury decided no criminal charges would be made against these officers. Police brutatlity is law-sanctioned murder. They claim they fear for their lives when in reality they are megalomaniacs and instigate. Mr. Chamberlain’s life was taken from us because of  ignorance, negligence of value for human life, racism and white supremacy. Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. deserves justice. Anthony Carelli and Steven Hart are still free walking around, and most likely still on the force. Carelli was involved in another federal case <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sources-identify-white-plains-anthony-carelli-triggerman-fatal-shooting-retired-marine-article-1.1056394" target="_blank">3 years earlier</a> for brutally beating two twin brothers while working on a disordlerly-conduct arrest. Too often these officers who kill people  have a track record. When I still lived in my hometown I went to protests for Mr. Chamberlian, I attended his candle vigil each year held in front of the White Plains Department of Safety, and I went to court battles to show support. I speak up about these issues because I cannot bear to see any more black lives taken in vain. We have a problem in this country and it needs to be addressed and fixed.</p>
