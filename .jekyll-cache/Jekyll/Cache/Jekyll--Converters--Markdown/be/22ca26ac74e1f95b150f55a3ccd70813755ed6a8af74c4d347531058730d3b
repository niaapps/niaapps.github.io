I"L<p>Hello reader.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to write, to share and to contextualize this part of me on my blog for so long. Life got really busy around the time I finally worked up the courage to come out a second time, updating my pronouns and aligning myself with specific words or a label.
If you know me in real life, or just follow my socials, you might know that I came out as transgender non-binary over a year ago in April. I’ve updated my pronouns from she/they to they/them/theirs.</p>

<p>I felt this change was necessary for a number of reasons… If you don’t care to know, or are simply at a point with your gender-identity education where you cannot hear this– that’s 100% valid. Bookmark it for when you are, because this post is everything I wish I knew, or wish someone had challenged and told me regarding the gender binary. So with an introduction out the way, let’s break it down.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-non-binary">What is non-binary?</h3>
<p>A generalized term, sometimes referred to an “umbrella” term as its reach is broad. A person who is non-binary feels they do not align exclusively with “woman” or “man” gender identities. Not to be confused with assigned sex at birth(which I’ll delve into later), sex and gender are two separate concepts. It’s 2023. You should know that. Congratulations if you’ve just learned such! (genuinely, I’m excited about your gender studies as a fellow scholar.) When I say “aligned” I mean to say the (expected) behaviors, perception and overall feeling these genders encompass.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-i-decide">How did I decide?</h3>
<p>I’ve always opted for gender-neutral language just because I want to be inclusive and respectful, plus, in most cases it’s simplifies the sentence I’m trying to say. You can see this even as I address you, I always say, “Hello Reader”. When you talk of someone whose gender you don’t explicitly know you already use singular they/them or non gendered terms. But nonetheless. I know many will take their time with this change for any non-binary person in their lives.</p>

<p>Those who were respectful before this change would use they/them, but for the most part I was referred to &amp; perceived as a woman.</p>

<p>After a very wholesome <a href="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14292407/pexels-photo-14292407.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1260&amp;h=750&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank" title="You know the kind ;) [alt: psilocybe cubensis the fungi]">trip</a> and an honest conversation with my partner I kept pushing the feeling of unfit puzzle piece down for nearly two years.</p>

<p>I find the binary extremely limiting.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h3>
<p>I get misgendered a lot. One reason I was so reluctant to socially transition was anger. It does make me angry to be misgendered. I don’t want to be seen as a man or a woman. I just want to be seen as a person. As the lovely, fun, kind, ambitious person that I am. Being misgendered makes me frustrated. It means my perceived gender expression is not matching up with my gender identity and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I know in part it’s not my doing, but instead societally held ideas [August’s article] like androgyny being inherently masc leaning are at play. But I wonder if the world will ever be ready for trans people who don’t medically transition.</p>

Touch on the idea that being non-binary is decolonized identity, other cultures often have a third+ genders, Muxes, 2S etc hjira</p>
