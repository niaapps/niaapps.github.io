<p>Hello Readers!</p>

<p>Today’s post is something I’ve been wanting to write for a while. I have been working on my inner voice a lot, how I speak to myself. With my upbringing this voice used to be very negative, mean, and insulting. I have realized over time that things shouted at me as a child from my abuser became my normal internal monologue over time. Changing the way I speak to myself has been really freeing. When I mess up or have a moment that I need to grow in, I can now say I often opt to treat myself with grace, patience and understanding. Being mean to myself does not serve me in any way. It does not make the situation better, and it does not make me feel better. So I simply don’t do it anymore. But how was able to change this behavior? That’s what we’ll jump into now :)</p>

<h3 id="shifting-and-improving-your-inner-voice">Shifting and Improving your Inner Voice</h3>
<p>So your brain is mean to you? You often see the negatives before the positives? You remind yourself what you are doing wrong before how far you’ve come? It’s ok. Whether your rude inner voice is a product of abuse, depression, anxiety, trauma or something else – I wish for you to know that it doesn’t have to stay this way. You can (and hopefully will) take the time and steps to improve this voice.</p>

<p>The first step (and ideally if you are reading this you’ve already done so) is observing that the tone and what your inner voice is saying is not making you feel good, or is not helping.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>If you find yourself saying...</em></p>
<div class="tab">
<p><em>I'm so bad at ___.</em></p>

<p><em>This situation would be better without me.</em></p>

<p><em>Useless... Why can't I do anything right?</em></p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>These are some example thoughts, but essentially you are looking and trying to observe thoughts that aren’t helpful. None of the above are in a frame where they wish to address or fix the problem at hand. None of these challenge whether that problem is real, or percieved through a lens of anxiety.</p>

<h5 id="reframing-your-thoughts">Reframing your thoughts</h5>

<blockquote>
<div class="tab">
<p><em>I'm so bad at ___.</em> would be a helpful thought as: <em>I have room to grow in this area.</em></p>

<p><em>This situation would be better without me.</em> 
s
This thought has no truth to it. Has someone told you a situation is better without your presence? Or are you assuming this because you cannot see your own worth and impact? This is the kind of thought I would recognize and say "I don't have any proof that this thought it true" let it go and move on, but I understand that might be hard for someone new to building a better inner voice. 

So a possbile rephrasing could be: <em>I will look for feedback about my position in this situation and move forward from there.</em> </p>

<p><em>Useless... Why can't I do anything right?</em></p>
</div>

<p>When I am sitting down to update or write new mantras I ask myself this question.</p>
