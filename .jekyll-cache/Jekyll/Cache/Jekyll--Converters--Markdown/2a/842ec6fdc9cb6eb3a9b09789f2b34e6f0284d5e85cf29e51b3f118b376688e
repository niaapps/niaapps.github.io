<p>Hello Reader. As we look upon a better tomorrow with the vaccination rates going up across the country I decided to reflect on some of the things that kept me sane during lockdown. Immersing myself in culture; both ones that I can be a part of and ones I can only appreciate from the outside, was one thing that kept me grounded. If you have not watched or read any of what I talk about today, I suggest you give them a try!</p>
