I"á<p>I recently watched a favorite youtuber of mine, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkDpZatLuIc&amp;t=3s">lavendaire</a> and she had a video about journaling + self discovery. Here is the reader-friendly version of it. I started these at the beginning of the month, instead of all in one day. This did come from my journal/diary, I have changed names to protect the people in my lifeâ€™s privacy. This was before developer week, and before/near the growing pains post.</p>
