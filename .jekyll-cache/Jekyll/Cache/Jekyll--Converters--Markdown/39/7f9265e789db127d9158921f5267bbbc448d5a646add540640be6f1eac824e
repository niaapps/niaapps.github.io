<p>So Iâ€™m working on revamping my website, as I may be doing more HTML work this summer and want to have something to show for it. Below is a gif of my Nav Bar with a hover effect I just finished. The extra space on the left will be for my new logo, which Iâ€™m in the process of designing. I know itâ€™s incredibly simple, but itâ€™s 12 am and Iâ€™m damn proud. More to come, definitely. What goes on a home page, I am beginning to ask myself. Know any good example sites? Comment them! Have any feedback? Get at me! Iâ€™m lonely at this hour.</p>
