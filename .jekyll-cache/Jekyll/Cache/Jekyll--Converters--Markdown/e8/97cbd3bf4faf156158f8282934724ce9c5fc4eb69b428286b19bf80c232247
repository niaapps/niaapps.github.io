<p>Hello Readers!</p>

<p>Todayâ€™s post is something Iâ€™ve been wanting to write for a while. I have been working on my inner voice a lot, how I speak to myself. With my upbringing this voice used to be very negative, mean, and insulting. I have realized over time that things shouted at me as a child from my abuser became my normal internal monologue over time. Changing the way I speak to myself has been really freeing. When I mess up or have a moment that I need to grow in, I can now say I often opt to treat myself with grace, patience and understanding. Being mean to myself does not serve me in any way. It does not make the situation better, and it does not make me feel better. So I simply donâ€™t do it anymore. But how was able to change this behavior? Thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll jump into now :)</p>

<h3 id="shifting-and-improving-your-inner-voice">Shifting and Improving your Inner Voice</h3>
<p>So your brain is mean to you? You often see the negatives before the positives? You remind yourself what you are doing wrong before how far youâ€™ve come? Itâ€™s ok. Whether your rude inner voice is a product of abuse, depression, anxiety, trauma or something else â€“ I wish for you to know that it doesnâ€™t have to stay this way. You can (and hopefully will) take the time and steps to improve this voice.</p>

<p>The first step (and ideally if you are reading this youâ€™ve already done so) is observing that the tone and what your inner voice is saying is not making you feel good, or is not helping.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>If you find yourself saying...</em></p>
<div class="tab">
<p><em>I'm so bad at ___.</em></p>

<p><em>This situation would be better without me.</em></p>

<p><em>Useless... Why can't I do anything right?</em></p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>These are some example thoughts, but essentially you are looking and trying to observe thoughts that arenâ€™t helpful. None of the above are in a frame where they wish to address or fix the problem at hand, whether that problem is real, or percieved through a lens of anxiety.</p>

<h3 id="ask-yourself-what-do-you-need-more-of-in-your-life">Ask yourself: What do you need more of in your life?</h3>
<p>When I am sitting down to update or write new mantras I ask myself this question.</p>
