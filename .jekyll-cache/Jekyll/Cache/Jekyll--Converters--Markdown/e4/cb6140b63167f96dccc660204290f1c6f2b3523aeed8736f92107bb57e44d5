<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been getting back to doing art, which I don’t always have time for because of work and school. I really needed the outlet after the Spring semester and some family drama going on. I compromised on my outlet and creativity. I noticed I do A LOT of work in bed and it can become uncomfortable with my laptop on my knees. I am currently painting a lapdesk that will make my life easier and I get to paint again and cherish in creating something artistic!! Here’s a picture of what I’ve done so far:</p>

<div class="scale-img">

<p>It’s definitely a bit aways from being finished, an d I was trying to do something with characoal on the upper right side. I’m doing basecoats for the valley as blue and will add in greens and orange later, while keeping up with shading from the moon, but stay tuned for how it turns out!!</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by my blog!</p>
