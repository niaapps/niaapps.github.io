I"¸<p>Hello reader.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been wanting to write, to share and to contextualize this part of me on my blog for so long. Life got really busy around the time 
If you follow me on Instagram or even know me in real life, you might know that I came out as trans non-binary over a year ago in April â€˜22 and updated my pronouns from she/they to they/them/theirs.</p>

<p>Those who were respectful before this change would use they/them, but for the most part I was referred to &amp; perceived as a woman.</p>

<p>After a very wholesome <a href="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14292407/pexels-photo-14292407.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1260&amp;h=750&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank" title="You know the kind ;) [alt: psilocybe cubensis the fungi]">trip</a> and an honest conversation with my partner I kept pushing the feeling of unfit puzzle piece down for nearly two years.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve always opted for gender-neutral language just because I want to be inclusive and respectful, plus, in most cases itâ€™s simplifies the sentence Iâ€™m trying to say. You can see this even as I address you, I always say, â€œHello Readerâ€. When you talk of someone whose gender you donâ€™t explicitly know you already use singular they/them or non gendered terms. But nonetheless. I know many will take their time with this change for any non-binary person in their lives.</p>

<p>I get misgendered a lot. One reason I was so reluctant to socially transition was anger. It does make me angry to be misgendered. I donâ€™t want to be seen as a man or a woman. I just want to be seen as a person. As the lovely, fun, kind, ambitious person that I am. Being misgendered makes me frustrated. It means my perceived gender expression is not matching up with my gender identity and I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing wrong. I know in part itâ€™s not my doing, but instead societally held ideas [Augustâ€™s article] like androgyny being inherently masc leaning are at play. But I wonder if the world will ever be ready for trans people who donâ€™t medically transition.</p>

<p>I find the binary extremely limiting. 
Touch on the idea that being non-binary is decolonialist, other cultures often have a third+ genders, Muxes, 2S etc hjira</p>
