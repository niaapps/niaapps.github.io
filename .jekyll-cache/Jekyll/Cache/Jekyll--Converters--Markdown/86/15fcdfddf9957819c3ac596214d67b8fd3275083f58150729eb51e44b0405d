I"÷<p>As we look upon a better tomorrow with the vaccination rates going up across the country I decided to reflect on some of the things that kept me sane during lockdown. Immersing myself in culture; both ones that I can be apart of and ones I can only appreciate from the outside, was one thing that kept me grounded. If you have not watched or read any of what I talk about today, I suggest you give them a try!</p>

I have not always been into cinema like I am today, but the more I watch, the more I am exposed to the more I fall in love with this specific way of human expression, storytelling and exposure.</p>

<h4 id="what-happened-miss-simone">What happened Miss Simone?</h4>
<p>Â Â Â 
Last year I watcher â€œWhat happened Miss Simone?â€ on netflix.
Iâ€™ve been watching movies/documentaries that are emotionally moving lately, almost as if amid all the craziness I need some sort of metaphorical hug. Nina Simoneâ€™s life was one of pain, tragedy, perseverance and an ode to the journey of being true to yourself. I felt it when she spoke about being free, that it meant to live without fear. I often find myself searching for that place, one where I have no fear. She meant this in the context of the Civil Rights Movement, where Black people and people of color can exist without fear because of racism and discrimination. I sincerely hope the strides we make get us to that world.</p>

<p>Â Â Â 
I watched Kinky Boots on BroadwayHD with a free trial. It was good. I donâ€™t often watch musicals, but something about the flashy outfits and heartfelt song made my bad day better. I watched the version where Lola is played by Matt Henry. In other versions of this Broadway show Lola has been played by Billy Porter and Wayne Brady. There is even a version where Panic at the Discoâ€™s Brendon Urie plays Charlie. The premise is that a family shoe factory is going out of business but is revived by the design of a Drag Queen named Lola and a cobbler Charlie who wants to make better shoes for this â€œniche marketâ€. I wonâ€™t spoil too much, but the scene that stuck out to me was when Lola has a bet with one of the workers to do something that makes them a man. Lola asks Don to â€œAccept someone for who they are.â€ Acceptance in my own life is hard for me. I often stride to change people. I cannot change conservatives to be more inclusive, and that is hard for me to accept. I know that people can be better, and it is a bare minimum for me to keep you in my life. I guess in a way I accept that I canâ€™t change them, but instead of subjecting myself to inhumane situations I close my circle. I continue to advocate in my own ways, and hope one day theyâ€™ll change.</p>

This one is a must watch. I am apart of the LGBT community because I am a bisexual woman, but that doesnâ€™t mean I know what it is like to be trans. This was a small window into my trans brothers and sisters. Before watching this Iâ€™d recently finished the seasons of POSE on Netflix so it was nice to see more vouging as well as MJ Rodriguez speak about her experience. Watching these trans men and women walk us through history with the way they have been depicted was eye-opening. The narratives patriarchy enforces are both harmful to trans people and women.</p>

I have honestly been slacking with reading for pleasure. I will reread fiction in spare time, but the pandemic has honestly drained that curiosity for something new in me. Here are two new books I have read recently</p>

<h4 id="gemini--an-extended-autobiographical-statement-on-my-first-twenty-five-years-of-being-a-black-poet-by-nikki-giovanni">Gemini : An Extended Autobiographical Statement on My First Twenty-five Years of Being a Black Poet by Nikki Giovanni</h4>
<p>Â Â Â 
Last summer I read Gemini by Nikki Giovanni. For the time her views were radical. She is regarded as a well renowned poet for works she published after <em>Gemini</em> was released. In this â€œExtended Autobiographical Statementâ€ she reflects on her first 25 years of life as a Black poet. She details how her writing has changed over time whether the influence is from her upbringing or from venturing into single motherhood. There are obvious serious tones in the book, as she was an integral call for Black power at the time. It should be noted as well there is a dose of homophobia and anti-semitism, both widely held ideals for the time period amongst the Black community. It struck me because sometimes both of those misguided views can be found in older generations today, but for the most part we have moved forward. Her writing is witty and she has a keenly unique voice, the unabashedness of putting herself into her work is admirable. I picked this up hoping to find kinship as I am half Black and I am a Gemini, my birthday two days before hers. I also consider myself a budding poet but did not find the connection I was hoping fo. Instead I came to enjoy this book for what is was, a womanâ€™s heart put into words capurting all that was happening around her.</p>

<h4 id="iktomi-and-the-ducks-and-other-sioux-stories-by-zitkÃ¡la-Å¡Ã¡">Iktomi and the ducks and other Sioux stories by ZitkÃ¡la-Å Ã¡</h4>
<p>Â Â Â 
I read Iktomi and the Ducks by Red Bird or ZitkÃ¡la-Å Ã¡, reading a story each night before bed, almost like being a kid again. Quarantine has me comforting myself amid all the craziness, and the stories are sort of meant to be told to children, each carrying a lesson. It was a light hearted read, and although I am not Sioux it was nice to get a slice of insight into Indigenous culture. This book was one of the few things I took from my father when we lost our home in 2018. He would gather books from various different North American Indigenous cultures. He always wanted to re-connect with our familyâ€™s Indigenous ancestry, something I have toiled with doing in the future. Ultimately Iâ€™ve learned from Indigenous creators on the internet that reconnection is a very arduous process if you have nothing to go on, and no real claims or access to that culture can be established. This is a result of colonialism and many struggle with the disconnectedness. Not all Indigenous people will accept you either calling for blood quantums and what not despite the anti-blackness of it all. Alas, the read was a gentle insight into cultures that were forbidden to practice for a long time in this country.</p>
