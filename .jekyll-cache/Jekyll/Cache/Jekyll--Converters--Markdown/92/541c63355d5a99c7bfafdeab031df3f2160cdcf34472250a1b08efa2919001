Hey Readers. I hope that all of you are safe where you are and that your families are well.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Iâ€™m sure you all have been keeping up with the news. We have yet again failed black people in this country [USA]. The death of &lt;a href=â€https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/us/george-floyd-trnd/index.htmlâ€ target=â€_blankâ€title=â€Article about the life of Floydâ€&gt;George &lt;/a&gt; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-worked-together.html" target="_blank" title="Article about the Murder of Floyd">Floyd</a> 6 days ago is another heartbreaking tradgedy. He was accused of using a fake bill at a store on completely unfounded grounds. The incident ended with him begging for his life, because 3 cops were on top of him, one, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on his neck for over 8 full minutes. He was murdered for the color of his skin. Just 2 months before we saw nearly the same thing happen to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kentucky-governor-calls-for-investigation-of-breonna-taylor-killing_n_5ebc625fc5b6cdefa7e8fb38" target="_blank" title="Article about Taylor's tragic death">Breonna Taylor</a> who had zero, literally nothing to do with the case the officers were actually investigating. Nonetheless her life was taken in the comfort of her own home. We only got a drop of decency from the department who released her partner Kenneth Walker, who was defending himself and Breonna from the people invading their home. Then there is &lt;a href=â€https://www.thecut.com/2020/05/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia-explainer.htmlâ€target=â€_blankâ€&gt;Ahmaud Arbery&lt;/a&gt; who was killed, simply jogging in his own neighborhood while black. The hate crime went unpunished for nearly &lt;a href=â€https://reason.com/2020/05/08/it-took-georgia-officials-2-months-to-arrest-and-charge-father-and-son-with-ahmaud-arberys-murder/â€target=â€_blankâ€&gt;2 full months&lt;/a&gt;, his killers living their lives as if they hadnâ€™t ended someoneâ€™s life prematurely because they could, because they are white supremacists.</p>

<p>Â Â Â This plight for justice has always been something I have cared about. I am biracial, and I know we are loathed at times because some people donâ€™t know how to act. (Iâ€™m looking at you<a href="https://twitter.com/lucky_Shanghai/status/1217664668434604032?s=20)" target="_blank" title="Beware, this is some clown shit.">Jeanie Reuter</a>) I am Black and I am Chinese. The thing is, I have privilege as a white-passing person and I am doing my community a disservice if I donâ€™t use it to uplift Black voicesâ€“ which are too often brushed off, ignored, or crushed. When I was a teenager my dad had a close friend who lost his father. His father was a Black Vietnam War veteran. He fell asleep on his life alert, an honest mistake. When he woke up, he called to let them know what had happened. Dispatch sent word, telling these two cops that their services were no longer necessary at the scene. These white cops did not listen. They took matters into their own hands. After exchanging harsh words with our veteran, who rightfully refused to let them into his home, they called him the hard r n-word, entered the apartment, tased and shot him, ending his life. I say his name, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Kenneth_Chamberlain_Sr" target="_blank" title="Wiki Page on Chamberlain">Kenneth</a><a href="https://www.bleausa.org/report-blasts-review-of-wppd-calls-justification-of-chamberlain-shooting-chilling/" target="_blank" title="Article about the incident">Chamberlain</a> &lt;a href=â€https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-s-office-closes-investigation-death-kenneth-chamberlainâ€target=â€_blankâ€ title=â€Closing Chamberlainâ€™s Investigationâ€&gt;Sr&lt;/a&gt; just as I say the three I mentioned earlier because this senseless killing must stop. Officers must be held accountable. In 2012 a Grand Jury decided no criminal charges would be made against these officers. Police brutatlity is law-sanctioned murder. They claim they fear for their lives when in reality they are instigators. Mr. Chamberlainâ€™s life was cut short because of  ignorance, racism and white supremacy and he deserves justice. Anthony Carelli and Steven Hart are still free walking around, and most likely still on the force. Carelli was involved in another federal case &lt;a href=â€https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sources-identify-white-plains-anthony-carelli-triggerman-fatal-shooting-retired-marine-article-1.1056394â€target=â€_blankâ€&gt;3 years earlier&lt;/a&gt; for brutally beating two twin brothers while working on a disordlerly-conduct arrest. Too often these officers who kill people  have a track record. I went to protests for Mr. Chamberlian, I attended his candle vigil each year held in front of the police department, and I went to court battles to show support, when I still lived in my hometown. I speak up about these issues because</p>
