<p>Film/Documentraries:</p>

<p>I just finished watching “What happened Miss Simone?” on netflix.
I’ve been watching movies/documentaries that are emotionally moving lately, almost as if
amid all the craziness I need some sort of metaphorical hug. Nina Simone’s life was one of pain,
tragedy, perseverance and an ode to the journey of being true to yourself. I felt it when she spoke about being free, that it meant to live without fear. I often find myself searching for that place, one where I have no fear. She meant this in the context of the Civil Rights Movement, where Black people and people of color can exist without fear because of racism and discrimination. I sincerely hope the strides we make get us to that world.</p>

<p>I watched Kinky Boots on BroadwayHD with a free trial. It was good. I don’t often watch musicals, but something about the flashy outfits and heartfelt song made my bad day better. I watched the version where Lola is played by Matt Henry. In other versions of this Broadway show Lola has been played by Billy Porter and Wayne Brady. There is even a version where Panic at the Disco’s Brendon Urie plays Charlie. The premise is that a family shoe factory is going out of business but is revived by the design of a Drag Queen named Lola and a cobbler Charlie who wants to make better shoes for this “niche market”. I won’t spoil too much, but the scene that stuck out to me was when Lola has a bet with one of the workers to do something that makes them a man. Lola asks Don to “Accept someone for who they are.” Acceptance in my own life is hard for me. I often stride to change people. I cannot change conservatives to be more inclusive, and that is hard for me to accept. I know that people can be better, and it is a bare minimum for me to keep you in my life. I guess in a way I accept that I can’t change them, but instead of subjecting myself to inhumane situations I close my circle. I continue to advocate in my own ways, and hope one day they’ll change.
