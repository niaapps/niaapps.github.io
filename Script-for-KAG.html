Below is a script I edited to email to Cameron Daniel, Kentucky's AG to demand Justice for Breonna Taylor.
Copy and paste then click <a href="mailto:attorney.general@ag.ky.gov?subject=I%20demand%20Justice%20for%20Breonna%20Taylor">here</a>  filling in your name/city/state respectively. Feel free to add anything to your email, this script just serves as a backbone.
</p>

<p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
My name is [insert name]. I am a resident of [State/City] and I am emailing today to demand accountability for the unjust murder of Breonna Taylor. 
</p>
<p>
I demand that charges be pressed against all officers involved in this horrifying racist murder, specifically officers Myles Cosgrove, Jon Mattingly and Brett Hankison. They should not be allowed to murder members of our community and continue to terrorize the communities they work in. All three officers should be charged and prosecuted to the full extent of the law for manslaughter. 
</p>
<p>
Breonna Taylor should be alive today if it was not for the abuse of authority and white supremacy exhibited by the Louisville Metro Police Department. Action on your part must be taken to prevent tragedies of similar nature in addition to delivering justice to Ms. Taylor's family in an honorable fashion. It is time the LMPD rights this wrong by holding their officers accountable.
</p>
<p>
As an Attorney General you answer to the vote of the people. We will remember how you respond to this murder when the election comes at the end of your term. It is in your best interest to listen to the voice of the people.
</p>

<p>In addition, I demand that we start addressing systemic issues that are pushed aside because we prioritize LMPD's 187,000,000 dollar budget. Instead we should divest this money into youth and education programs, housing and healthcare programs as well as helping the disabled population and the homeless population. 
</p>
<p>Sincerely, 
[your name]
</p>
