Hi there,
My name is Nia Williams and I am the developer behind the Strawberry theme. I created this theme from scratch
specifically for<a href="https://twitter.com/Imani_Barbarin" target="_blank" title="">Imani Barbarin</a>
 who runs <a href="crutchesandspice.com/" target="_blank" title="">Crutches & Spice</a>.
I am not a Wordpress developer per se but developing this theme was something within my capability and I would do it again.
If you would like me to make a custom theme for you please reach out. If you wish to use Strawberry theme please <a href="/contact.html" target="_blank">contact me here</a>.
Strawberry theme is not free to use. I require a one time payment of $150 to provide/prepare the theme files for you.
If you would like me to install the theme for you it will cost a one time payment of $300, this is inclusive
of the original $150.
This pricing does not include any additional fees for extra custom pages. (Honestly I am proud of the default page as is and should work for most purposes!) 
All prices are in USD.
Strawberry theme is copyrighted. Any illegal use will warrant charges. 

You can view more of the theme here. I also wrote a blog post about the theme here. 

Thank you for stopping by, have a wonderful day!
