&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Readers. The other day I asked for some feedback on what you want to learn more about. I got a reply asking to explore more about AI or Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you hear AI, what is the first thing that comes to mind? Are you an enthusiast, knowing the first AI were used to play chess against humans? Do you think of Alexa, the AI on Amazon devices, or being able to say “Hey Google!” to your android phone(Siri for iPhones)? Do you recall AI like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RealSophiaRobot?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sohpia&lt;/a&gt; the human-like robot who can tweet, hold a conversation and so much more! Maybe your mind goes to the technical side, to ML (Machine learning). All of these are under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. This post will be talking about several AI projects from the last 10 years to today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ml-of-my-ai-pun-on-apple-of-my-eye&quot;&gt;The ML of my AI &lt;sub class=&quot;mouse-over&quot;&gt;(Pun on “Apple of my Eye”)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into specific and exciting tech let’s lay some groundwork. In order for any AI to operate they have to be taught first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;machine-learning&quot;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are trying to teach a child how to get ready for bed. First you would do the things for them to give them the general structure: brushing their teeth, washing their face, etc… Then once they know the steps, you would monitor them to verify they can do it themselves, correcting any mistakes they make in the process. Machine learning (ML) is a lot like this example. We teach computers how to do a task and then monitor them until they have an acceptable success:fail ratio for deployment. ML allows computers to explore data and recognize patterns. An example would be YouTube suggesting relevant videos to you. It makes a prediction based on your watch history, your location and its internal data on videos you haven’t watched yet. ML is essentially the term for teaching AI or machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deep-learning-neural-networks&quot;&gt;Deep Learning, Neural Networks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning(DL) is a subset of ML. Deep learning is ML that is based off of the human brain. AI that learn with deep learning will have an artificial neural network. DL requires a large data set to teach the machine. This is both expensive and time-consuming as you often need &lt;a href=&quot;http://niaapps.github.io/niaapps-blog/updates-coding/2021/05/31/Cryoto-Craze.html#GPU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;My last post where I talk more about GPU's&quot;&gt;GPU’s&lt;/a&gt; which possess higher processing power. AIs that employ DL will take in a data-set, teach themselves to recognize patterns and then give predictions based on what it learned. Neural networks are how we model the human brain. These networks are made up of artificial neurons. They have an input and output layer, and some layers in between that help AI decipher information it takes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;symbolic-ai&quot;&gt;Symbolic AI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Deep learning existed AI was dominated by Symbolic AI AKA Good, Old-Fashioned AI. Symbolic AI does not require massive amounts of data like other ML. It does not ensue training or guesswork like other methods either. Symbolic AI do have access to a knowledge base- symbols to represent our real world. By representing problems as symbol it uses logic to problem-solve. Symbolic AI use relational statements. Let’s say we have a &lt;!-- &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Virtual Strawberry Donut I made during a hackathon&quot;&gt;--&gt;strawberry donut.&lt;!--&lt;/a&gt;--&gt; We can represent symbols inside ().&lt;br /&gt;
So:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 
(donut)&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
Relations are used as descriptors, descriptors are shown next to the symbol, so:&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
strawberry(donut)&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s say I eat this donut:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 
Eat(Nia, Donut) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 
Symbolic AI uses truth tables, or propositional logic to understand the world around it.
Let’s say I am eating a freshly baked strawberry donut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;fresh(donut)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;strawberry(donut)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Eat(Nia,donut)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;fresh(donut) AND strawberry(donut) AND Eat(Nia,donut)&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
  	&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever taken a discrete math class, this is an AND truth table. You’d know that for the last column to be true the first 3 must also be true. AND meaning propositional logic or gates. AND is true when both statements are true and false if one or more statement is false. Another common gate is OR, which is true if either statement is true, and false if both are false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short example of how an AI could come to understand a situation. It would most likely see true as 1, and false as 0. It would compute AND as multiplication and OR as addition. Symbolic AI has these and other gates at its disposal to figure out the world and solve problems. It is admirable how they accomplished so much with so little, before the advent of Deep Learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;natural-language-processing&quot;&gt;Natural Language Processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural language processing(NLP) allows AI to understand our everyday language. It grants them the ability to translate sentences from one language to another. This is because it can understand the meaning of a sentence. NLP is rule based human language. It is often used with Deep learning(Neural NLP) to help enhance AI’s ability to understand voice commands. NLP includes speech recognition, sentiment analysis, understanding references, and name entity recognition. (Ex: understanding that Seattle is a city, or that Yessenia is a person’s name). NLP also deals with natural language generation; coming up with sentences on its own to respond to users. This type of ML is used in a lot of AI because the everyday user will still need to communicate with its machine and direct it to use it. Previous to Deep learning, NLP was used with Symbolic AI or Symbolic NLP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-10-years-ago&quot;&gt;About 10 years ago…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;2010---2015&quot;&gt;(2010 - 2015)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 years ago when you heard of AI the connotations were either gaming (both video games and popular game shows) or the budding virtual assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kinect&quot;&gt;Kinect&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 Microsoft came out with the “Kinect” for it’s Xbox 360 console. It was the first gaming device to track human movements using infrared and a 3D camera. It uses AI algorithms to process the data it receives about your environment through its lens. Then in turn it controls the console without a physical controller. Kinect was taught through machine learning how the human body works, so it correctly digests the input it receives. It was taught to understand depth: how close or far you were to it in view of you, as well as detecting the different parts of a person. Telling apart our arms from legs, head from chest, etc. The same technology is used in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/kinect-sign-language-translator-part-1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;kinect sign language translator&lt;/a&gt;. You can explore Kinect’s other uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://analyticsindiamag.com/kinect-sensor-the-ai-tool-you-did-not-know-you-had/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;watson&quot;&gt;Watson&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM released its question-answering computer “Watson” in 2010. It could answer questions if posed in natural language. Watson is used for information retrieval, advanced natural language processing, knowledge representation, and automated reasoning. All of these skills applied to questions and answering, open to nearly any topic. Watson competed against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter some of Jeopardy!’s top past players. Watson won against both of them in practice runs before airing, and twice in two actual games. Watson also played against US Congress members, also claiming a win. You can read more in detail &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)#Jeopardy!&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Recounting of Watson on Jeopardy!&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;siri&quot;&gt;Siri&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007 SRI Artificial intelligence center developed the template for what would later become Siri. Apple acquired the tech in 2010, tweaking it for their IOS devices before releasing it in 2011. Siri is the first modern digital virtual assistant. Siri uses NLP and machine learning to aid its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alexa&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexa, Amazon’s virtual assistant was debuted in 2013. Alexa like other assistants can process natural language questions, and as of 2018 can even have back and forth dialogue with its users. Alexa was taught with Deep learning. In 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/4/18168565/amazon-alexa-devices-how-many-sold-number-100-million-dave-limp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt; reported 100 million devices with Alexa on them had been sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cortana&quot;&gt;Cortana&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Apple’s lead Microsoft developed their virtual assistant Cortana. It was released for their phones in 2014, expanding it onto PC’s in 2015. Microsoft eventually discontinued the assistant on their phones in 2017. Again, like the other virtual assistants, NLP plays a big part as well as DL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-years-ago-to-today&quot;&gt;5 years ago to today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;2016-2021&quot;&gt;(2016-2021)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI from 5 years ago to today have branched out into so many different areas unlike 10 years ago. We are on the brink many amazing discoveries in multiple areas. Some areas include entertainment, business, and general research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;google-assistant&quot;&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google also followed suit of Apple and Microsoft and released their Google Assistant in 2016. Today it comes standard on phones, Google home and home-mini and more. The same NLP is used as well as DL to interact and understand its user’s better as well as provide more accurate searches and help with tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sophia&quot;&gt;Sophia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanson Robotics had us on the edge of our seats in 2016 when they debuted Sophia, a human-like robot. “She” was created for researching human-robot interactions, and it’s potential applications for entertainment. Sophia is the first robot Innovation Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme. Like IBM’s Watson, Sophia uses NLP, in addition to neural networks, symbolic AI and more. Sophia uses machine perception and can recognize human faces and even has emotions. Explore more about Sophia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hansonrobotics.com/sophia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;More about Sophia&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;facebook-chat-bots&quot;&gt;Facebook Chat-bots&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research(FAIR) lab created two chat-bots in 2017. Both bots used machine learning algorithms to teach them how to converse. FAIR had both chat-bots learn how to negotiate. They were given a set of items (each having a point value) and told to split the items between themselves and someone (human) or something (another chatbot or other AI) else. Eventually to develop more of this skill they had these chat-bots go through “Reinforcement Learning” with each other. Left to their own devices the two chat-bots deviated from their normal negotiation patterns. They eventually created a new way of communicating that diverged from human language. We know that they were communicating because points were still awarded when a trade was made. Even if the language looks like gibberish to the human eye, it is still indicative of the bots trying to negotiate. The situation was unexpected, but it helped further AI research. Specifically, how AI operate when not being pushed to do what we want them to do, what do &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; choose to do? For it’s desired purpose the project was a failure and eventually shut down. From an objective point of view research can be drawn, taken and used from this instance. You can read more &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/2017/06/14/ml-applications/deal-or-no-deal-training-ai-bots-to-negotiate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;FB engineering article on the chabots&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; You can find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookresearch/end-to-end-negotiator&quot; targer=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;code of chatbots on github&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; repo and view the code or deploy it yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;android-alter-3&quot;&gt;Android Alter 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next piece of AI is a jointly developed project from researches at the University of Tokyo and Osaka University. They released Android Alter 3 in 2018. Its purpose is the similar to Sophia, to understand how humans would react to an autonomous robot. The researchers hope to “explore fundamental questions of whether robots can obtain a sense of life, and what life itself may mean.”
Android Alter has prosthetic skin for it’s face, neck and arms, it was not designed to be identical for humans. This AI actually conducts a human orchestra. Its movements are based on a CPG (central pattern generator) which functions like a human spinal cord. Alter 3 also uses a neural network. This project has had performances around the world, from Australia to Japan and even Germany. The piece Alter 3 conducts is called “Scary Beauty” produced by Keiichiro Shibuya. Alter 3 decides the tempo, volume and singing expression. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/UFkItzIC02g&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a clip of a performance in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;waymo-driver&quot;&gt;Waymo Driver&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you recall in 2008 Google was starting development on self-driving cars, or autonomous vehicles. In 2009 Google founded Waymo with the specific purpose to keep working on self-driving cars. 9 years later Waymo Driver had its debut. The technology can be applied to several car models and in Phoenix Arizona you can catch a ride on the Waymo One. It is like Lyft or Uber, you can use their app to get a ride around the city, except Waymo One drives itself. This tech has been tested in 10+ states and Waymo asserts they are “The most experienced driver in the world”. Waymo Driver has driven billions of miles in simulation and millions of miles on public roads. In addition to Waymo One for people Waymo Driver can also be used on trucks or what they call Waymo Via for moving goods across the country. Waymo Driver uses machine learning to detect the things around it as it drives. Whether it’s other cars, cyclists or pedestrians, it predicts what they may do and takes precaution accordingly. You can explore more about Waymo &lt;a href=&quot;https://waymo.com/waymo-driver/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ai-and-covid-19-vaccines&quot;&gt;AI and Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2020 Baidu a Chinese tech company aided in the development of covid-19 vaccines with their LinearFold AI algorithm. According to Baidu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;LinearFold predicts the secondary structure of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence of a virus—and does so significantly faster than traditional RNA folding algorithms. LinearFold was able to predict the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence in only 27 seconds, 120 times faster than other methods. This is significant, because the key breakthrough of covid-19 vaccines has been the development of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. Instead of conventional approaches, which insert a small portion of a virus to trigger a human immune response, mRNA teaches cells how to make a protein that can prompt an immune response, which greatly shortens the time span involved in development and approval.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not specified what AI learning techniques were used, or how the algorithm was developed. I thought the  inclusion of AI in the medical field was too significant to not mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;scale-img&quot;&gt;
&lt;img id=&quot;img-id&quot; src=&quot;/../../images/van-gogh.png&quot; alt=&quot;My letter from Van Gogh AI&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;letters-from-beyond-the-grave&quot;&gt;Letters from beyond the grave&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June of this year my partner took me on a date to the Immersive Van Gogh exhibit here in NYC. While it was enchanting and exciting, I mention it because at the end in the gift shop you could scan a QR code and receive a “letter from Van Gogh”. You guessed it! They had an AI read all Van Gogh’s past letters and trained it to write in his style. You give the AI your name as ask it a question, or give it some sort of topic and “he” will write you your very own letter. Receive your own letter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lettersfromvincentny.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Letter writing Van Gogh AI&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have highlighted interesting and important AI here, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.g2.com/articles/history-of-artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Complete History of AI&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a more comprehensive list if you wish to learn more. Also of note is a organization that hopes to teach the AI leaders of tomorrow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.corp.aiclub.world/ai-for-kids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;AI for kids&quot;&gt;AI for kids.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing this I’ve found myself a little inspired. If you can think of a fictional AI from a game, movie, TV show or anime comment it! I plan to compare fictional AI to real-world AI, and see what tech we have surpassed, measure up to, and hope to achieve in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Reader. &lt;br /&gt;
 As we approach a better tomorrow with the vaccination rates going up across the country I decided to reflect on some of the things that kept me sane during lockdown. Immersing myself in culture; both ones that I can be a part of and ones I can only appreciate from the outside, was one thing that kept me grounded. If you have not watched or read any of what I talk about today, I suggest you give them a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;moviesdocumentaries&quot;&gt;Movies/Documentaries:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have not always been into cinema like I am today. The more I watch, the more I am exposed to, I’ve found myself falling in love with it. This specific way of human expression, storytelling, and exposure is unique and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-happened-miss-simone&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Happened Miss Simone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last year I watched “What Happened Miss Simone?” on Netflix. I’ve been watching movies/documentaries that are emotionally moving lately. It’s almost as if amid all the craziness I need some sort of metaphorical hug. Nina Simone’s life was one of pain, tragedy, perseverance, and an ode to the journey of being true to yourself. I felt it when she spoke about being free, that it meant to live without fear. I often find myself searching for that place, one where I have no fear. She meant this in the context of the Civil Rights Movement. A place where Black people and people of color can exist without fear due to racism and discrimination. I sincerely hope the strides we make get us to that world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kinky-boots&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kinky Boots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I watched Kinky Boots on BroadwayHD with a free trial. It was good. I don’t often watch musicals. This time something about the flashy outfits and heartfelt song made my bad day better. I watched the version where Lola is played by Matt Henry. In other versions of this Broadway show, Lola has been played by Billy Porter and Wayne Brady. There is even a version where Panic at the Disco’s Brendon Urie plays Charlie. The premise is that a family shoe factory is going out of business. It is revived by the design of a Drag Queen named Lola and a cobbler Charlie. Charlie wants to make better shoes for this “niche market”. I won’t spoil too much, but the scene that stuck out to me was when Lola has a bet with one of the workers to do something that makes them a man. Lola asks Don to “Accept someone for who they are.” Acceptance in my own life is hard for me. I often strive to change people. I cannot change conservatives to be more inclusive, and that is hard for me to accept. I know that people can be better, and it is a bare minimum for me to keep you in my life. I guess in a way I accept that I can’t change them, but instead of subjecting myself to inhumane situations, I close my circle. I continue to advocate in my own ways, and hope one day they’ll change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This one is a must-watch. I am a part of the LGBT community because I am a bisexual woman, but that doesn’t mean I know what it is like to be trans. This was a small window into the trans community. Before watching this I’d recently finished the seasons of POSE on Netflix so it was nice to see more voguing. MJ Rodriguez also makes an appearance speaking about her experience. Watching these trans women and med walk us through history with the way they have been depicted was eye-opening. The narratives patriarchy enforces are both harmful to trans people and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moonlight&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moonlight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Moonlight touched my heart. To be a Black and Gay man especially in a southern state like FL is a difficult predicament, and adding poverty to the mix made it so real and relatable to me. This is a coming of age story. This is a story of learning to be who you are. I won’t say more than that. It should still be on Netflix and it deserves all the love and praise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;books&quot;&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have honestly been slacking with reading for pleasure. I will reread fiction in my spare time, but the pandemic has honestly drained that curiosity for something new in me. Here are two new books I have read recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gemini-an-extended-autobiographical-statement-on-my-first-twenty-five-years-of-being-a-black-poet-by-nikki-giovanni&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gemini: An Extended Autobiographical Statement on My First Twenty-five Years of Being a Black Poet&lt;/em&gt; by Nikki Giovanni&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last summer I read Gemini by Nikki Giovanni. For the time her views were radical. She is regarded as a well-renowned poet for works she published after Gemini was released. In this “Extended Autobiographical Statement” she reflects on her first 25 years of life as a Black poet. She details how her writing has changed over time. The influences come from all sorts of places, like her upbringing or venturing into single motherhood. There are obvious serious tones in the book, as she was an integral call for Black power at the time. It should be noted there is a dose of homophobia and antisemitism. Both of these were widely held ideals for the time amongst the Black community. It struck me because sometimes both these misguided views can be found in older generations today, but for the most part, we have moved forward. Her writing is witty and she has a keenly unique voice. The brazen act of putting herself into her work is admirable. I picked this up hoping to find kinship as I am half Black and also a Gemini, my birthday two days before hers. I also consider myself a budding poet but did not find the connection I was hoping for. Instead, I came to enjoy this book for what it was, a woman’s heart put into words capturing all that was happening around her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iktomi-and-the-ducks-and-other-sioux-stories-by-zitkála-šá&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iktomi and the ducks and other Sioux stories&lt;/em&gt; by Zitkála-Šá&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 I read Iktomi and the Ducks by Red Bird or Zitkála-Šá, reading a story each night before bed, almost like being a kid again. Quarantine had me comforting myself amid all the craziness. The stories were originally meant to be told to children, each carrying a lesson. It was a light-hearted read, and although I am not Sioux it was nice to get a slice of insight into Indigenous culture. This book was one of the few things I took from my father when we lost our home in 2018. He would gather books from various different North American Indigenous cultures. He always wanted to re-connect with our family’s Indigenous ancestry, something I have toiled with doing in the future. Ultimately I’ve learned from Indigenous creators on the internet that reconnection is a very arduous process if you have nothing to go on, and no real claims or access to that culture can be established. This is a result of colonialism and many struggles with disconnectedness. Not all Indigenous people will accept you either calling for blood quantum and whatnot despite the anti-blackness of it all. Alas, the read was a gentle insight into cultures that were lawfully forbidden to practice for a long time in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also been watching anime and reading self-help books, but wanted to save your eyes from a long post. Thanks for reading! Let me know in the comments what has been keeping &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; sane during lockdown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey Readers! &lt;br /&gt;
After asking for some feedback on what you want to learn more about I got two replies asking to delve more into Cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crypto-in-laymans-terms&quot;&gt;Crypto in layman’s terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency is defined as a digital currency where transactions and records are hosted on a decentralized system using Cryptography (“the art of writing or solving codes”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchain&quot;&gt;Blockchain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand cryptocurrency you first have to understand what Blockchain is. In simplest terms, it is a system that holds information. These blocks of info are secure because of their decentralized nature, meaning no one corporation, government or authority has control over the information. These accessible digitized blocks are all linked together. Once a block is accepted on the chain it cannot be augmented or deleted. No one can contest that that information doesn’t exist or that in the case of crypto, a transaction was not made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockchain transaction has 4 steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    1. A transaction/trade is recorded.
    &lt;br /&gt;
    2. This trade is verified by a majority of nodes (computers in the network). 
    &lt;br /&gt;
    3. It is added to a block.
    &lt;br /&gt;
    4. Once the block is done it is added to the chain. (blocks can have multiple transactions)
   
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain isn’t only for cryptocurrency, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/CsxjlsBYmrI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Medical Chain video explaining MedicalChain&quot;&gt;MedicalChain&lt;/a&gt; uses Blockchain to securely help patients interact with doctors, health insurance companies, and pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bitcoin&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most cryptocurrencies operate on Blockchain, the same level of security doesn’t exist without its use. We’ll break down cryptocurrency transactions using Bitcoin(BTC) as an example, being the pioneer of Cryptocurrency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretend for a moment you have 1 BTC. Let’s say you hire me for a project and want to pay me with your BTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Blockchain.com a trading platform&quot;&gt;blockchain.com &lt;/a&gt; or some other site with access to your crypto wallet in order to submit a fraction of your BTC to mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve just done &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, comes verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using Blockchain you have a digital identifier. This ID comes in two parts: a Private or Secret Key and a Public Key, similar to your computer’s public and private IP address. My Public ID for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; specific transaction would be calculated based on the data from the transaction and my private key, which remains constant, that no one else has access to. Just like with an IP address, it is very important to make sure no one has access to its information. Then additional code checks the transaction ID and my public key to verify that it was created with my private key and no one else’s. After these credentials are approved this ID is attached to our transactional block to confirm that I verified this transaction. In addition to just us, because the chain is public, every full node also has to verify the transaction (nodes are programs on computers that hold all the transactions ever made on the chain and as a result require a lot of memory to store). Owners of each node are incentivized to do so with a idea called “Proof-of-Work”, a concept that will be discussed later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, If you complete other transactions(sending/receiving/transferring) they would be added to your block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, The block is added to the chain for the entire world to see. Every transaction that is made has a new, different ID or signature based on the transaction and your secret key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin uses a cryptographic hashing function. Hashing is a means of translating numbers and letters to different ones to ensure its security. Specifically used is SHA-256 which stands for Secure Hashing Algorithm. SHA-256 uses 256 bits for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10087/what-is-the-meaning-of-trapdoor-in-cryptography&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;An explanation on Trapdoor functions&quot;&gt;Trapdoor functions&lt;/a&gt; to calculate these keys. Trapdoor functions are easy to calculate one way but extremely difficult to go backward from if you are missing some information, in this case, your secret key. Imagine trying to guess a password that has 2&lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt; digits. That is an enormous amount. Here’s a 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;amp;q=2%5E256+full+number&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;2^256 written out&quot;&gt;link to it written out.&lt;/a&gt; This is just one reason using a blockchain is so secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you may be asking “What if someone lies about how much BTC they have and try to overspend?” As soon as you transfer and convert USD or your desired currency, it becomes a transaction that is added to the chain, public to everyone. You cannot overspend more BTC than you own because all of your transactions are on the chain, tallying up exactly how much you do or don’t have. In this sense, the history of transactions itself &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the currency. You can go take a look at all the current transactions of Bitcoin right now by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/explorer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Blockchain explorer&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, we talked about nodes in step two who are rewarded when they use “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Investopedia article about POW&quot;&gt;Proof-of-Work&lt;/a&gt;”. Full Nodes on the network verify every transaction, and by doing so can mine BTC in the process. People who own these full nodes or computers have them solve extremely complex math problems, sometimes taking days to complete. The result is a hash (also in SHA-256). This concept lets nodes prove they have done computational “work” to assert consensus on the transaction that needs to be verified. When a majority is reached over a transaction’s validity (All nodes have hashed and verified) it is then added to the chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GPU&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Buying isn't the only way&lt;/h3&gt; 

Another way you can get in on Bitcoin is to set up a computer to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Investopedia article about BTC mining&quot;&gt;&quot;miner&quot;.&lt;/a&gt; Miners use Proof-of-Work to solve those complex equations to “mine” bitcoin. Upon solving these problems a bitcoin is produced. When you convert USD to BTC you are buying these “mined” coins. These miners are awarded with bitcoin for every new block of transactions they add to the chain. The catch is that with each new block the reward becomes halved every 210,000 blocks. This usually takes about 4 years, but for the sake of reference in 2009 the reward was 50 BTC and as of Feb. 2021 it’s 6.25. Bitcoin mining has a connection to a class I just took last semester, Computer Architecture. We learned briefly about GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and to set up Bitcoin mining many recommend a GPU as opposed to a CPU because of its higher throughput, or ability to do more work in a given amount of time. I made a presentation on a study comparing a CPU and GPU if you are interested, comment down below or on Instagram, I’ll post it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mystery-surrounding-the-creation-of-bitcoin&quot;&gt;Mystery Surrounding the Creation of Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin was developed in 2009 by an individual who used the pseudonym &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Wiki about Mr. Nakamoto&quot;&gt;“Satoshi Nakamoto”&lt;/a&gt;. He is presumably Japanese  (assuming the creator is just one person). The person behind this wrote Bitcoin’s white papers and deployed its original implementation. Several people have claimed to be Satoshi but the creator still remains anonymous today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drawbacks-areas-of-concern&quot;&gt;Drawbacks, Areas of Concern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not cheap to run computers with this much processing power. For that reason, it is secure, because not everyone can afford to do so. However, this raises the question of the accessibility of cryptocurrencies. As solving the hashing problems becomes more complex more expensive computers with strong processing power and larger system storage will become necessary. At some point, it will become too expensive for the everyday citizen to own full nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many also need to consider the environmental toll of Bitcoin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-is-skyrocketing-along-with-its-price/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;CBS article about BTC and carbon emissions&quot;&gt;One &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(21)00083-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to the study&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that BTC’s carbon emissions are steadily approaching being equal to the entire city of London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alt-coins&quot;&gt;Alt Coins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any coin that isn’t Bitcoin (the first cryptocurrency) is referred to as an Alt-Coin. Some common ones are Ethereum, LiteCoin, and Dogecoin. For a time they were referred to as “Shit coins” because tons of companies were giving out initial coin offerings (ICO’s) with the promise to make money, but none of them panning out as well as BTC did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dogecoin&quot;&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogecoin is another mineable cryptocurrency that also uses blockchain tech as well as Proof-of-Work. It was created as a joke in 2013, as a sarcastic homage to Bitcoin. It’s grown exponentially since its inception especially after the battle between Wall St and small investors back in January of 2021 over GameStop stock shares. Dogecoin’s value fluctuates like other crypto but its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dogecoins-market-cap-north-of-70-billion-makes-it-the-fourth-most-valued-coin-301300602.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about Dogecoin's market capitalization&quot;&gt;market cap&lt;/a&gt; is climbing to a net worth of a little over $70 billion. It is the 4th most valued cryptocurrency. According to Billy Markus, one of Dogecoin’s co-creators, its original low barrier entry was to make it accessible, so anyone could get into it. Recently dogecoin hit .74 cents (May 8th), and many individuals made a lot of money. I personally bought a small amount when I had a few bucks lying around, and the rise and fall of it is exciting, to say the least. Many investing experts have predicted that it will &lt;a href=&quot;https://capital.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-all-the-way-up-to-1-usd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Capital.com article about Dogecoin&quot;&gt;eventually even hit $1&lt;/a&gt; at some point. As for a timeframe concerning such growth, there is debate whether it will reach such heights by the end of this year or if it could take years. Companies are also beginning to accept Dogecoin as a payment method, for example, the Kessler group which owns hotels across the country, or the Dallas Mavericks for basketball ticket sales. Given all this, Dogecoin certainly has the potential to grow. What once was a joke, is now being recognized as a potentially viable investment. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ethereum&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency. It is also decentralized and uses blockchain technology. If you have been hearing about NFT’s or non-fungible tokens, you may already know about Ethereum. NFTs are exclusively held on the Ethereum Blockchain. Ethereum is also mined and uses Proof-of-Work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and taking the time to dip into the magical universe of tech, I hope you learned something new about Crypto!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello Readers, thanks for being here :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of ways to spend your weekend. The third week of January I spent mine staying up coding a project for a hackathon. This was actually my second hackathon, my first was back in 2013. I participated in CUNY Hackathon 2021, and I really pushed myself. I usually work alone as a freelancer and haven’t worked on a team since my internship in 2018, [The relationships being more mentor like than peers.]. It was my first time working with peers much less people I’d just met! Stretching my social-ness and getting over the fear of something new was a big step in of itself. My team and I quickly began brainstorming ideas days before hack time was scheduled and actually ended up executing my idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came up with the idea for a “Charity Clock” in high school but throughout the hackathon, the idea was augmented to fit our purposes. I struggle a lot with waking up on time and through the pandemic it has only gotten worse (bad circadian rhythm, being less active, not going out as much). The point of this app was to motivate me to get out of bed. Time in this app will literally cost you. Alternatively, on the flip side, if I did sleep in, I would feel less bad because I am donating to an organization or charity I care about and trust to do good work. We settled on the name PenniezZZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outcome--reflections&quot;&gt;Outcome &amp;amp; Reflections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately hackathons are a short period and we did not get to finish in time. I still had an amazing time meeting new people and learning from my teammates. As mentioned before, I normally work alone, which means my git repo is just me, it’s easy to scrap and create a new repo when a mistake is made. This experience taught me so much about how important version control is and so many new git commands that are super useful. Learning how to navigate git in a new way was invigorating. I have had the goal of going to a 1 hackathon per semester for a couple of years and this is actually the first time I’ve actually done it. The pandemic actually made it so I had no excuses, as it was moved online. The barriers of transportation, food, and time were all taken away. This hackathon was also free to participate in so that helped! Even though the hackathon is over, one teammate and I continued to work on he PenniezZZ app, but eventually they had other responsibilites that came first. Below you’ll find the DevPost submission, a link to my fork of the github repo (where you can watch my progress as I finish it in my spare time) and a video demo of the unfinished app. I have actually already signed up for another hackathon hosted by MLH who sponsored CUNYHackathon, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Readers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a coding post about some work I have been doing in JavaScript both on this site and on a project I have for work. I’d say I’m a novice with JS because of how infrequently I use it as opposed to HTML &amp;amp; CSS. The language is widely used across the internet, so I pick it up when I need to. The challenge for me was that markdown/liquid is not intuitive for me. These new-age programming languages strip important parts so that you don’t have to be a techie to use them. In the same respect they lose abilities/functionality in some areas. I am old school in that sense. Figuring out how to use JavaScript with the markdown features for my site was my only hiccup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s lay groundwork, for those who don’t know. JavaScript ≠ Java. JavaScript, usually abbreviated to JS is a high level programming language that allows you to implement more complex features when developing webpages. The two demos I have for you today are a selector to sort my blog posts, and a Text size range slider. In the past the only significant work I can recall using JS for is making a site “infinite scroll.” These really only scratch the surface, here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://marvinthompson-code.netlify.app&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Marvin's Portfolio site&quot;&gt;Marvin Thompson&lt;/a&gt; that has done way cooler stuff with JS. Marvin is another up and coming full stack web developer, and works with React which is a JS frame work. Linked above is his portfolio site. One notable project of his is &lt;a href=&quot;https://facespace.netlify.app&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;FaceSpace is meant to be like Facebook&quot;&gt;FaceSpace&lt;/a&gt;. It is a social media project meant to emulate facebook. It just goes to show how much you can do with JS. Now that you have been amazed by the great work JS can achieve, here are the small things I’ve utilized it for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a selector, or in plain terms a drop-down sort. I have been wanting to implement this feature for a while. Personally, having an idea vs executing it is a little daunting sometimes… It is easier to jump in if you’re being paid to do it, as opposed to doing something for my own site. I have slowly been finding myself becoming a perfectionist, so I worked up the nerve to dare to try something I may suck at first, like most beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#coding-posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#personal-posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#all-posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Html/markdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    {% for post in site.categories.updates-personal %}
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ post.url }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {% endfor %}
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way this works is each div for all posts, coding posts and personal posts have markdown in them that generates an unordered list with links to respective posts. In markdown, each post has a category declared in its front matter. I use a for loop to generate each. By default in the CSS above you can see the all posts div is shown and the separated personal and coding posts are set to display none. Next is the JS to tell the selector which div to display and which divs to hide, switching each time a new selection is made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;show_post_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/*In the HTML above we set the value of all posts to 1, coding posts to 2 
    and personal posts to 3.

    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;personal-posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;all-posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;coding-posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each separate if statement contains a block that passes the id of each div, changing the CSS style display to either inline-block or none depending on what we need. I also made the selector black to fit the webpage theme. &lt;a href=&quot;https://niaapps.github.io/niaapps-blog/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can see it in action on my blog home page&lt;/a&gt;, and below is a gif to demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scale-img&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;gif of selector on blog home page&quot; src=&quot;/../../images/js-demo.gif&quot; oncontextmenu=&quot;alert('Please don\'t download this photo!');return false;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I made with JS is a text size range slider for a client’s site.  I used an input tag with the type set to range to achieve this. It is an accessibility feature that you should consider implementing on your own website. Creating accessible web pages is important in addition to minimum standards being required by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Text Size: &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;size&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;range&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;min=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;16&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;max=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;30&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;16&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;slider&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;font-range&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;post-text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does this work? Begin by setting a div’s id to equal “post-text”(any text you want to change in size). Above is a function that takes the output of the slider and sets the style font-size of post-text to be equal to it. The second line is so the user can see the value they are setting it to. I chose these colors to fit my client’s site, but any would do if you were to implement this. I created the “arrow” or triangle by using border-left, top &amp;amp; right on the “thumb”. It is important to code for both moz (Mozilla) and WebKit (chrome, safari). Check out the demo below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;slidecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text Size: &lt;span id=&quot;size&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot; min=&quot;19&quot; max=&quot;40&quot; value=&quot;19&quot; class=&quot;slider&quot; id=&quot;font-range&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  var slider = document.getElementById(&quot;font-range&quot;);
  var output = document.getElementById(&quot;size&quot;);
  output.innerHTML = slider.value;  
  slider.oninput = function() {
  output.innerHTML = this.value;

&lt;p&gt;In digital spaces across the internet amid all the rallies for racial justice, there has been a sub conversation surrounding colorism. Colorism is defined as the prejudice of skin color within the same race. It is prevalent not only in African American culture but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/2184747/asias-addiction-whiter-skin-runs-deep-backlash-has-begun&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about colorism in Asian cultures&quot;&gt;Asian cultures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about colorism in South Asian cultures&quot;&gt;South Asian cultures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorism_in_the_Caribbean&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about colorism in Caribbean cultures&quot;&gt;Caribbean cultures&lt;/a&gt; and many more across the globe. The conversation revolves around the same thing: anti-blackness and the idolization of lighter skin. The bias that darker skinned people face within their own communities is an enigmatic burden to bear that can and should be dismantled. The act of challenging your own anti-black ideals subconscious or not is an act of decolonization that in my opinion is necessary if we want everyone to be truly equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is without a doubt that you have witnessed colorism at work before. Colorism is adults telling young children to avoid the sun for fear of “being too dark”. Colorism is favoring one child over another for having lighter skin. Colorism is “They are pretty for a dark skinned person”. The distinction between colorism and racism is again that this happens within respective communities and not from someone outside of the community. Colorism is prevalent in everything, from hiring practices (favoring lighter skinned candidates) to the skin lightening industry becoming a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/global-currents/profiting-from-the-skin-lightening-trade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about the skin lightening industry and it's worth&quot;&gt;$23 billion dollar&lt;/a&gt; business. The reality is darker skinned people are made to feel shame in something they cannot control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are extensive first-person accounts out there, but I’d like to highlight someone who has both talked and written about her experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peou Tuy is an author and spoken word poet, she has survived through the Khmer Rouge as an infant and came to America as a refugee, living her life as a Khmer American. She is a darker skinned Asian woman and has faced colorism her entire life in the Khmer community. Here is a poem she wrote from her book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Khmer-Girl-Peuo-Tuy/dp/097796230X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to Peou's Book Khmer Girl on Amazon.com&quot;&gt;Khmer Girl&lt;/a&gt; titled “Bleaching My Skin”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;no-select&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hate her even in my sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;dream I sharply slice her off&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;new fresh layers of white skin grow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am forced to live with her&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the sight of her makes me vomit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I consistently tell her she is too dark to be on me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;but she insists it is not her fault&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;this color-haterism thing is biologically inherent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;lightening cream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;whiten her off my face&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;praying it will dry her out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;shedding off layers after layers after layers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In showers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I turn the dial to boiling hot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;in order to burn her to death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;from my face to my neckarmscheststomachbackbuttocksthighslegsfeet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I harshly scrub her off with a coarse cloth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;dipped in sodium lauryl sulfate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;burning her firey red&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hate her!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hate her!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hate her!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitch! You desrve it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    
   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peou also speaks of her experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://nearyheng.com/podcasts/skin-lighteners-you-can-bleach-your-skin-but-you-cannot-bleach-your-true-you-identity-peuo-tuy-p2of2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to podcast where Peou talks of her experience with Colorism&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; Some notable quotes from the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I felt horrible, I was told constantly by Khmer communities and people on the street ‘Oh she’s so dark!’ My parents would say ‘Yeah she’s the darkest one.’ or ‘Why don’t you wear this color, it looks better on you because you’re dark.’ and I felt like I was not worthy enough to live, I felt like my dark skin was a sin, I was told that every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“As a child you get traumatized by that, thinking light skin is a better and the more light skinned you are the more successful you may become. I was very upset with the Khmer communities and my parents for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I felt like I had to compensate for my skin color.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, she describes how her brothers, also dark skinned, never got the same talks adding on to the intersectionality of the colorism issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Women are meant to be elegant and porcelain-looking and light and pure and smooth, with men it’s a little bit different, sexist I would say, their skin color didn’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to make the distinction, no one is saying that light skinned people do not face discrimination or racism, but we are saying it is imperative to recognize how the societal hatred of darker skin is hurting your community and how your actions can further normalize this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about history for a moment. The roots of colorism in America is nearly identical to the Caribbean. In both cases, the class stratification starts with enslavement and colonization. A social hierarchy purported by the White ruling class: putting whiteness at the top, blackness at the bottom, and mulattos (A mix of European + Black or Caribbean heritage respectively) somewhere in the middle based on perception. You can listen more about colorism in the Caribbean from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/frances-robles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Frances Robles NYT page&quot;&gt;Frances &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FrancesRobles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Frances Robles Twitter&quot;&gt;Robles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12001750&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;NPR episode where Frances Robles speaks about her experience with Colorism in the Caribbean&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;. This post will be focusing on colorism in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the study &lt;a href=&quot;https://7c2c4239-2cae-4bf7-9d24-e25021092699.filesusr.com/ugd/5fff9b_738c19918f21490a904304b5852ed5f4.pdf?index=true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;full pdf from Dr. Reece&quot;&gt;“Genesis of U.S. Colorism and Skin Tone Stratification: Slavery, Freedom, and Mulatto-Black Occupational Inequality in the Late 19th Century”&lt;/a&gt; written by Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;amp;user=fEDQllQAAAAJ&amp;amp;view_op=list_works&amp;amp;sortby=pubdate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Dr. Reece's Google Scholar page&quot;&gt;Robert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robertlreece.com/research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Dr. Reece's website&quot;&gt; L. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PhuzzieSlippers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Dr. Reece's Twitter&quot;&gt;Reece&lt;/a&gt; it was found in the U.S., that colorism has been prevalent both during and after slavery, providing Mulattos greater opportunities than their Black counterparts. Dr. Reece delves on many significant points. He sets the stage with that which we should already know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Research shows lighter skinned Black Americans outperform their darker skinned counterparts in income (Goldsmith, Hamilton, &amp;amp; Darity, 2006, 2007), education (Branigan et al., 2013; Monk, 2014), health (Diette, Goldsmith, Hamilton, &amp;amp; Darity, 2015; Monk, 2015); receive shorter prison sentences (Blair, Judd, &amp;amp; Chapleau, 2004; Viglione, Hannon, &amp;amp; DeFina, 2011); and are perceived as more attractive (Reece, 2016).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colorism permeates every aspect of life, it is something dark skinned people don’t have the privilege of ignoring. Next, Reece goes into specifics about the advantages lighter skin provided during chattel slavery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Enslaved Mulattos received a number of advantages relative to their Black counterparts. Because Whites generally thought Mulattos were sharper, more esthetically pleasing, and more capable of being “civilized”, they often offered them positions as house servants, away from the toils of field work, and afforded them the opportunity to acquire trade skills and other education that they could use outside of the plantation. Moreover, they were given significantly more freedom to move throughout and off the plantation (Frazier, 1930; Toplin, 1979)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evident that this edge was no more than a happenstance because the White ruling class decided Mulattos were more “valuable”. However, dismissing the existence of this privilege is ignoring the barrier that holds back the darker skin people in our community. Similarly, how it is true that light skin people can face racism but can benefit from colorism (instead of being hurt by it), Dr. Reece talks of how being enslaved had varying degrees of effects on Black people vs Mulattos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Legacy of slavery is negative and significant for both Mulattos and Blacks, meaning both suffered lower occupational status as the proportion of slaves in 1860 increased, but the magnitude is much stronger for Blacks than Mulattos. This supports the primary hypothesis, suggesting although Mulattos and Blacks both suffered the negative effects of slavery, Blacks seemed to have suffered much more in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Literacy in 1860 is positive and significant for Mulatto occupational status, which means Mulattos in counties where they could read and write in 1860 had, on average, higher occupational status in 1880. Conversely, literacy in 1860 is nonsignificant for Blacks. This is evidence the preference for Whiteness that began during antebellum slavery allowed Mulattos to leverage their favorable color to capitalize, however limitedly, on opportunities that Blacks may not have been able to access. While this did not completely shield Mulattos from the negative effects of slavery, it offered a buffer to soften the effects relative to Blacks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occupational status is arguably the most important aspect colorism could negatively affect in 1860. Despite the immoral connotation that your value is determined in how productive you are, in the US having the ability or skills to work to attain wealth is viewed as an asset. This disparity in who had the opportunity to advance has greatly shaped our workforce today, from hiring practices to wage gaps. While I was researching I began to ask myself, “Why feed the hate, if already so much of the world is against Black people, no matter skin tone? Why would discrimination within the same community continue to grow?” The next two excerpts help me deduce a plausible explanation, both historical and present-day connections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“However, I argue the transition from slavery to freedom resulted in more than simple emulation in the case of Blacks and Mulattos. Instead, the boundaries between the two groups may have strengthened. Wimmer (2008) offers a theory of ethnic boundary formation that may be useful for explaining this possibility. He argues actors emphasize ethnic boundaries when they are incentivized to do so. In places where slavery was more prominent, Mulattos may have been incentivized to practice social closure strategies to strengthen the boundary between themselves and their Black counterparts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…people receive social favor in proportion to their position on a sliding scale of visible Blackness. The “more White,” “less Black” a person looks, such as lighter skin, thinner noses, thinner lips, and straighter hair, the more White in-group benefits they receive, lifting their social position above their “Blacker” counterparts. Moreover, when a group—Black people—is forced to acknowledge the supposed superiority of a group higher on the social hierarchy—White people—they may also offer them preferential treatment, explaining why Black people also tend to favor lighter skinned people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We no longer live in the 1880s. There have been tons of strides made since that time, but alas the work is far from done. Acknowledging that colorism is alive and thriving today is necessary. Our standards for beauty on a societal level are European. Due to colonization, this is on a global scale, which is partially why colorism happens worldwide in a variety of different cultures. In the second quote, Dr. Reece pinpoints the heart of the issue of colorism: the social favor based on a light skinned person’s likeness to whiteness. Black features should not be seen as “unattractive” or undesirable. Whiteness should not be the standard for beauty. Colorism extends and negatively affects the very livelihood of darker skinned Black Americans. This is what is meant when people say “light skin privilege.” Whether you [in this case a light skinned person] knowingly or unknowingly benefit doesn’t matter. You do. You also can choose to carry on and enable colorism to discriminate or be conscious of the fact and strive to create more equal situations. We are amid a deep cultural shift, and so I pose to you: call colorists out and advocate in your daily life to unlearn these micro discriminatory habits that have macro effects on darker skinned people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately his study came to an important conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“These results not only deepen our conceptions of early colorism by demonstrating it is indeed connected the circumstances surrounding chattel slavery, but they also offer insight into some of the specific antebellum mechanisms that created the post-Emancipation gap between lighter skinned and darker skinned Black Americans. Most notable is probably the differential effect of slavery on Blacks and Mulattos. Although a variety of sources documented Mulattos’ preferential treatment as slaves, until now we understood little about how privileged treatment translated into post-slavery social outcomes, empirically or theoretically. However, the positive effect of slavery on inequality and literacy Mulatto occupational status support the premise that the preference for Whiteness thesis may feed into boundary formation processes that allowed Mulattos to maintain their advantageous position over Blacks even as both suffered from the antebellum system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you all to read Dr. Reece’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robertlreece.com/research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Dr. Reece's research page on his website&quot;&gt;work.&lt;/a&gt; They are well researched and provide insight into topics like Colorism that are not as widely explored by other academics. I personally plan on reading “The Gender of Colorism: Understanding the Intersection of Skin Tone and Gender Inequality” next, which was written this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History is the background of this painting, but as we approach the metaphorical foreground where is the situation now? As it is with most 21st century issues, capitalism comes knocking. Companies like Unilever profit off of dark skinned people’s insecurity, which as I’ve demonstrated is perpetuated on a societal level. Just this past June Hindustan Unilever has come under fire amid the renewed racial justice protests. Their product &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glow_%26_Lovely&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to wiki on 'Fair and Lovely' lightening cream&quot;&gt;“Fair and Lovely”&lt;/a&gt;, a lightening cream that has been on the market since the 1970s is being scrutinized for its name as well as it’s use. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/business/unilever-jj-skin-care-lightening.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about Unilever and J&amp;amp;J facing criticism for skin lightening products&quot;&gt;Unilever has since changed the name&lt;/a&gt; to “Glow and Lovely” but the concoction remains the same, lightening people’s skin tone. Johnson and Johnson will rename some products to stop the emphasis on “fairness” as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/business/hindustan-unilever-fair-and-lovely-intl-hnk/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Secondary article about Unilever and J&amp;amp;J facing criticism for skin lightening products&quot;&gt;discontinuing &lt;/a&gt;some lightening creams.
Right before 2019 came to a close two non-profits garnered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/us/colorism-amazon-skin-lightning-bleaching.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about Amazon and Colorism&quot;&gt;23,000 signatures asking Amazon&lt;/a&gt; to discontinue it’s participation in selling skin bleaching products. Surprisingly, Amazon listened. Again, it should be known that the skin-lightening industry was on track to becoming a $23 billion dollar industry. Skin lightening or skin bleaching is not considered safe by any means by the FDA, yet these products continue to be made and stocked on shelves. Products that hurt people on both a psychological(the idea that one’s skin tone they are born with needs to be “fixed”) and physical level should not flourish on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s recap. Colorism hurts melanated people, it can give lighter-toned people a sort of implicit advantage because of it’s likeness to whiteness. Colorism’s roots stem from white supremacy as well as anti-blackness. It exists on the individual as well as the institutional level. Once you acknowledge the existence of this colorism issue, what can be done? Well to start, educating yourself and others further about why dark skin is perceived as undesirable and acknowledging it is something people have no control over. Educate yourself on the implicit bias you may have and actively work to bring light to them and challenge them to level the playing field. The shade of someone’s skin tone should not be a factor when dating, hiring, deciding pay rate, or any other issue that is linked to someone’s livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello readers!
Today’s post is about how I have been coping with all the craziness of the pandemic, racism, police brutality and overall bad news. In addition to talking with your loved ones and those who you seek out for support, music can also be a form of relief. I listen to music both to come to terms with reality and to feel better. That’s how this playlist is set up. I listen to a lot of genres, so this playlist is a mix. It moves through 12 songs from a place of feeling lonely, lost and angry to emotions in between and ending off in a place of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvZucUeG2u9BLKbApChEQR9auxyTKfh_j&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here is the link to the Youtube Playlist &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHhND-BkWdk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;All Alone &lt;/a&gt;by Gorillaz featuring &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rootsmanuva.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Roots Manuva&lt;/a&gt;. During this time it can easily feel like you’re all alone. Please, text or call your family and friends, you are never really alone, but people cannot read your mind. No one will know you need support if you don’t ask for it. This song is rumored to be about Manuva’s outlook on the world. The pacing of the beginning builds a feeling of sadness and disappointment. A plea to again be alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=votgfrZpq7Q&amp;amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&amp;amp;index=73&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Breathe You In&lt;/a&gt; by Grace The Enemy. This band’s lead is a woman with a delicious scream and a lovely singing voice. The lyrics call out as if you are searching for validation, for redemption:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Holding on to this dream we’ve made&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m less if not crumbling,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know my mind won’t be the same&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As long as we remain undying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breathe you in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwhelmed, As I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breathe you in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take my hand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Show me life as I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breathe you in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breathe you in!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a call to perseverance, to keep going, to breathe in the good, and to remain undying in your stride. To fight for something higher, something better. I believe that I have needed this advice. When this social distancing began I didn’t want to take the situation in. I didn’t want to believe I’d be stuck inside for 3+ months. Once I took the situation in it became easier to see the pandemic not as a loss of everything I once knew, but a gain of something new and unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBjQ9tuuTJQ&amp;amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&amp;amp;index=69&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Pretender&lt;/a&gt; by Foo Fighters. I personally love this song and play it all year round. It gets me hyped up to do anything. The better part of my adult life has felt like a fight. I fight to survive, fight to drag myself out of poverty, fight to keep food on the table and a roof over my own head. Discovering this song a few years ago was very uplifting for me. Whenever I need the push to get back on my feet, I remember the lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What if I say I’m not like the others?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if I say I’m not just another one of your plays?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re the pretender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if I say that I’ll never surrender?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that I’m somehow special, “not like the others” makes me feel empowered. The idea that I’ll never surrender, I’ll always keep going makes me feel strength. Not falling into the “pretender’s” play; that notion is very powerful. To be able to stand in the face of opposition and refusing to bow down. There has been a lot of discourse online about what they meant by pretender. For me personally the pretender is my depression. She wants to lie around all day pretending I can waste away. I pretend when I am depressed that my life isn’t worth living, but it always has been and will continue to be. This song gives me the strength to fight another day, to see my worth, and to keep growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Segueing into something lighter, next is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS6sDhqVROs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Something’s Gotta Give&lt;/a&gt; by All Time Low. Despite the band’s name the music they make can be very relatable and even uplifting. I have felt fed up with the state America is in long before these protests. This song shines a light on feeling like you’re at your wit’s end. The chorus goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Wake me up, say enough is enough,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m dying to live, something’s gotta give.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pull me out of this sinking town,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m dying to live, something’s gotta give!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first lyric is a plea, and I feel like I have been trying to “wake people up” to the truth. When I see those who are misguided it almost feels like they are asking me to enlighten them. They probably aren’t, but I can’t seem to stop myself from correcting misinformation. I want to wake people up to the truth of the racist system we are governed by. Wake them to the truth of white supremacy that hovers around every corner. Show them the truth that we all live on stolen indigenous land. Too many turn a blind eye to people struggling, but I will no longer blink in the face of ignorance. We are dying to live to our full potential. Black people are &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; being killed by both law enforcement and the bias within the system. Something does have to give, something has to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also relate to this song in the fact that we are all stuck inside from the pandemic, slowly passing the time, wanting something to give with the virus. I truly hope that we are at a new norm by the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment you realize generational pain has been being placed on the shoulders of every new generation because not enough changes are being made, you can begin to feel…hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgc3_4WL0M&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Kiri&lt;/a&gt; by Monoral. The Japanese rock band’s song was popularized by the grungy anime &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_Proxy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ergo Proxy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You complete my fate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world unwinds inside of me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You complete my fate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The halo crawls away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You repeat my fate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rewinding all we can&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You refill my place&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You refill my place, place”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lyrics speak to me a lot right now. The notion that history repeats itself, and that we are all completing each other’s fate, refilling each other’s place. The pattern of getting older and seeing someone younger in your place. It reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aishaoxley/status/1266965056027340800&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;this video &lt;/a&gt;that has been circulating online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course I can’t forget the chorus, the pleading echoing line sung 5 times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Come and save me.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple prayer of finding reprieve, redemption, for all the suffering to birth something worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we transition from that hopelessness to somewhere still sad but more level with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is another throwback &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XleOkGsYgO8&amp;amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&amp;amp;index=7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Move Along&lt;/a&gt; by All American Rejects. “Move Along” is some of the best advice I have received. Sometimes it’s easy to succumb to our emotions, or the way we feel about situations in our lives. If you shorten transition time (idea I read from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12138871-18-minutes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Peter Bergman&lt;/a&gt;) and choose to look forward and keep going it will be easier to get through your day to day. As the song says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Speak to me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When all you got to keep is strong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move along, move along like I know you do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And even when your hope is gone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move along, move along just to make it through&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move along&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move along”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all you have is movement, moving into the next moment. I try to make it better than the last, the small steps add up to a significant recognizable change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_O_T6Aq85E&amp;amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&amp;amp;index=44&amp;amp;t=0s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Snap Out Of It&lt;/a&gt; by The Arctic Monkeys. Too often I find myself stuck in a rut. Now that all this extra time is available to us it can be so easy to fall victim to spending a significant amount of time on our phones, or on social media. Many times a week I will find I am glued to facebook or twitter. I feel the pressing need to stay in the know. To be aware of the state of this country given all the protests and police brutality people are rallying against. Sometimes you need to snap out of it for your own mental health. Remember to draw the line for your own well being, because if you don’t you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; burn yourself out and we need everyone at their best right now. The best you possibly can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have gotten past the anger, we have gotten past the shock of the current moment, we have snapped out of it. Now we want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw-GdthJGuo&amp;amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9BLKbApChEQR9auxyTKfh_j&amp;amp;index=7&amp;amp;t=0s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rise Again&lt;/a&gt;. This song is by Equilibrium, one of the most uplifting metal folk bands I’ve ever stumbled upon. This song came from my “Hype” playlist. Once you are past all your low-vibrational emotions, you need something to help you pick yourself back up. As the lyrics go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Let’s get forward, no time to rest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t really matter if east or west&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So many roads are unexplored&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The journey is its own reward&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I feel it inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My eyes are open wide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My heart will acclaim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sun will rise again”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song is all about living to see another day and cherishing the moment. Garnering the courage to seize that moment and truly appreciating it. No matter where in your journey it happens to be you can appreciate it for what it is. It’s about finding the drive to pick yourself up as you move and act with intention. During this time inside it has been hard to stay productive at times. It’s okay if you stray, but coming back and rising again is crucial to making progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next in line is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUmV-MorIKc&amp;amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&amp;amp;index=30&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Patience&lt;/a&gt; by Tame Impala. The hypnotizing chorus, (and I say hypnotizing because that’s how all their songs make me feel) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Just growin’ up in stages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Lay down, low down)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Livin’ life in phases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another season changes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And still my days are shapeless”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When quarantine began, the weather was still chilly. I still had to wear the lighter of my two winter coats. We have seen the change of the end of winter, to spring and now we have the summer solstice coming up on June 21st. I still had structure from school, but once the semester ended I have been feeling my days are a bit shapeless. To be fair to myself, this website was only 50% done when quarantine began, and now I am writing to you daily on this blog. Patience is also a virtue I have been struggling with, but am trying to have more with myself and others. I have been doing a ton of self discovery during this time, which is why the first and third lyrics resonate with me deeply. I’m taking things one day at a time, but cannot deny the transition I’ve been going through. The same can be said about the political unrest we are seeing in the air. All the anger and trauma are being transmuted into malleable changes. Police Departments across the country are having resources rerouted back into communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The embodiment of this next song, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoS9rEfHKwo&amp;amp;list=RDEMlDgR2N2D5vOyaWLoYcMwdw&amp;amp;index=8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Everybody’s Something&lt;/a&gt; by Chance the Rapper feat. Saba and BJ The Chicago Kid, is that no one’s life is nothing. Everybody is someone to somebody. Chance is an outspoken man of faith and he does right by it in this song. The bridge and chorus goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nice to see you Father New Year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Middle finger Uncle Samuel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shooting death with weighted dice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And hitting stains on birthday candles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know somebody, somebody loves my ass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cause they help me beat my demons ass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everybody’s somebody’s everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know you right&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nobody’s nothing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s right&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two lines are said to be Chance acknowledging the beauty of seeing another year, but flipping off Uncle Sam is a criticism of our government. Chance has not been all talk, he has put an enormous amount of his resources back into Chicago’s community and government. The next two lines are debated about whether he means death is weighting the dice in its favor for Chicago’s youth. Or if the youth are weighting them escaping death another year. In addition echoing back to what I was saying with The Pretender and depression, this is looking at it from the other side. “Cause they help me beat my demon’s ass”. No one should have to fight their demons alone. You matter to someone; at the very least one person in your life, even if that person happens to be yourself, or someone you haven’t even met yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end, we come to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSivlaSVk1k&amp;amp;list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&amp;amp;index=17&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;We Got The Power&lt;/a&gt; by Gorillaz. I was trying to not repeat artists on this playlist, but this song is exactly what this playlist needs. At the end of the day through all the terrible things happening in the world, we have power. The chorus goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We got the power to be loving each other, no matter what happens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve got the power to do that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On a le pouvoir de s’aimer, okay?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We got the power to be ringing the great bell out there above us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We got the power for that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We got the power to do that”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as humans can choose to feel unity. The lyric in French sung by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehnny_Beth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jehnny Beth&lt;/a&gt; translates to “We have the power to love one another, okay?” I urge you reader, when it is safe to go out once again, get to know your community. Your neighbors, the local shop owners, the people in your immediate area. You are even more fortunate if your town has a community center, check out local events. We see these racists online and ask how they can be so hateful and ignorant. It is because they aren’t exposed to people who don’t look like them. They make assumptions and don’t fact check their news. They follow an orange menace who spews hate, bigotry, xenophobia and much more. Spending time with people in your community is a great way to make friends and feel empathy for others. We have always had the power to keep loving each other. Be the example you want to see in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzQWCeguH30&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Crystal Clear&lt;/a&gt; by Hayley Williams. This song is fairly new, it is about seeing things as they truly are and as Williams says in the echoing chorus, much like a mantra:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Crystal Clear, I won’t give into the fear.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these troubling times it is important to look at the situation without fear, but rather objectivity. Giving into fear will only make your decisions erratic and possibly dangerous. Seeing things in new light can be incredibly liberating. The second I started looking at quarantine as a detriment I lost all power in the situation. I now see this just is, and I need to make the best of it and have been attempting to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, let me know what songs you are using to cope with in the comments below!
Lastly I found this artist while searching for songs, while I don’t know any of them well enough to put them on this playlist, Yves Tumor, an upcoming Black Non-Binary artist deserves your time, so please lend your ear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/N0c7lVHMyaY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Kerosene!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LJ4o9ppV4yg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Romanticist/Dream Palette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you next time and stay safe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello my readers, hoping you are keeping hope amid these unpredictable times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is my birthday. It is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breonna-taylor-fbi-investigation-shooting-louisville-police/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Breonna &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Breonna_Taylor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Taylor’s&lt;/a&gt; birthday. Instead of talking about me I would like to talk about her story. Breonna would have turned 27 today. She was an essential worker, an EMT. She was a University of Kentucky graduate and steadily pursuing her career in the medical field. She was serving her community and her country by working during a  pandemic. That in itself is admirable,  the bravery it takes to work during the spread of a deadly virus should  not be overlooked. In an &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869930040/as-the-nation-chants-her-name-breonna-taylors-family-grieves-a-life-robbed&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; interview released yesterday family and friends talked about her and her life. How she said she would make a name for herself. I want that to sink in. She was very young and had her whole life ahead of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her life was taken, family described the loss as feeling they were robbed. The incident occurred past midnight on March 13th, 2020. We know now that three cops in plain clothes entered her home on a no-knock warrant. Kenneth Walker, Breonna’s boyfriend said that after hearing loud bangs on the door, Breonna repeatedly asked &lt;em&gt;“Who is it?”&lt;/em&gt; with no response. Walker, a licensed gun owner then armed himself due to lack of response. Police used a battery ram to enter the apartment. Walker shoots first, logically assuming these men are burglars as they did not identify themselves. He then shot one robber in the leg. Officers responded by opening fire of &lt;em&gt;more than 20 rounds&lt;/em&gt;, shooting Breonna at least &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, ending her life. Kenneth was arrested at the time, but has since had all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boston25news.com/news/trending/charges-dropped-against-breonna-taylors-boyfriend-police-chief-retires-fbi-joins-probe/MDUWBEGADNHSVKIWVV3G42BZLA/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;charges dropped&lt;/a&gt; on grounds of self-defense. Breonna had an ex-boyfriend who was in custody for selling drugs, and suspected of shipping them to Breonna’s home. She had nothing to do with the drugs but the no knock warrant that a judge awarded was &lt;em&gt;based on this suspicion&lt;/em&gt;. No drugs were found in the apartment. This negligence cost Breonna her life. Family and friends tell the truth, that she was not that type of person, who would risk the life she had for something as silly as drugs. It has been 84 days since her death. On May 21st the F.B.I. began an investigation but the three cops are still out there employed on the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-knock_warrant#cite_note-nyt19m-1 &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; and use of no-knock warrants is all bad news. The number of no-knock raids has increased from 3,000 in 1981 to over 50,000 in 2005. From 2010 to 2016 31 civilians died at the hands of officers using a no-knock warrant and 81 civilians died during SWAT raids using no-knock warrants. More than half of civilians killed were a minority, 42% of them African American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is heartbreaking to hear how a woman full of so much life and promise is no longer with us. Police brutality has been on the rise in the US. From 2013-2019, police in Kentucky killed &lt;a href=&quot;https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;122 people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Black people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;three times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; more likely to be killed by police than White people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read my last &lt;a href=&quot;https://niaapps.github.io/niaapps-blog/updates-personal/2020/05/31/Black-Lives-Matter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; you may recall that Black people are also three times as more likely to die from the COVID-19. Breonna was risking the last of her days in more ways than one. If you are born Black it should not warrant suspicion, the color of your skin should not be a death sentence. This injustice has not gone unnoticed. Protests are happening to garner support and awareness for Ms. Taylor. We need to continue putting pressure on the Louisville Metro Police Department to arrest Myles Cosgrove, Brett Hankison and Jonathan Mattingly. Recently we saw how the same fight for accountability can have positive results as the degree of murder in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/3-more-minneapolis-officers-charged-george-floyd-death-derek-chauvin-n1222796&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;George Floyd&lt;/a&gt; case was raised as well as the arrest of other complicit officers. We need the same swift action for Breonna Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img id=&quot;img-id&quot; src=&quot;/../../images/breonna3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; alt=&quot;A memorial for Breonna Taylor&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take a moment and give space to Breonna Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago I wrote about the tragedy that stole Ms. Taylor’s life. She and I have the same birthday, yesterday June 5th. She would be 28 if 4 white cops did not have the ability to abuse the power they have. It’s been 450 days or a year and 85 days since her murder. Not nearly enough has been done to bring justice and accountability for her family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what has happened since:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While all of the cops involved were either fired or resigned themselves, none have been convicted for her murder&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jonathan Mattingly got a Book Deal with a small press, but luckily in protest it’s distributor Simon &amp;amp; Schuster refuses to ship the books.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly after this decision Mattingly announced his retirement&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myles Cosgrove was fired, it has been determined his 16 rounds ended Breonna Taylor’s life. He was fired for violating use of deadly force procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joshua Jaynes was fired for violating the standard operating procedure for truthfulness. Jaynes acquired the no-knock warrant for Breonna Taylor’s apartment, but withheld from the judge that the US Postal inspector did not confirm Breonna’s Ex was receiving packages at her home. Jaynes did not verify, but swore to it in the affidavit when obtaining the warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brett Hankison was indicted for “wantonly endangerment” of the first degree, in relation to shooting the apartment next door. Charges and indictment were decided by a 12 person grand jury.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hankison would later be fired from the force for the same charge he received, but his superior made the distinction that it was for “wantonly and blindly” firing 10 shots into Breonna Taylor’s apartment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Ann Bailey Smith postponed the trial of Hankison for wanton endangerment in connection to Ms. Taylor’s murder. Originally it was scheduled from Aug. 31st 2021 and now is on Feb. 1 2022 The judge cited the pandemic for the postponement. Hankison’s next pre trial date is next month, July 16th at 11am. This trial could finally convict one of Ms. Taylor’s murderers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Breonna’s law was passed in Louisville banning no-knock warrants in the city&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kentucky governor signed into law limiting no-knock warrants across the state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a wrongful death suit Ms. Taylor’s family is being awarded $12 million USD. Tanika Palmer, Taylor’s mother has said the reforms and 12 mil do not equal justice for her daughter’s death. In her words “It’s time to move forward with the criminal charges.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can say that you believe that Black Lives Matter to you, please don’t let Breonna Taylor slip from your mind. Continue to say her name. Continue to advocate for the charging and conviction of all four of the cops mentioned who had a hand in her death.  As mentioned before Hankison’s next pretrial date is July 16th at 11am. I often share resources on my site to help, from call scripts to put pressure on representatives, to emailing people whose job it is to make decisions for constituents in regards to public safety. I will share them here as well as I find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart goes out to Ms. Taylor’s family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Readers. I hope that all of you are safe where you are and that your families are well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you all have been keeping up with the news. We have yet again failed Black people in this country [USA]. The death of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/us/george-floyd-trnd/index.html&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about the life of Floyd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-worked-together.html&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about the Murder of Floyd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floyd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 6 days ago is another heartbreaking tragedy. He was accused of using a fake bill at a store on completely unfounded grounds. The incident ended with him begging for his life, because three cops were on top of him, one, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on his neck for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 full minutes and 46 seconds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. He was murdered because of the color of his skin. Gruesomely two months before we saw this same story of Black lives being robbed happen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kentucky-governor-calls-for-investigation-of-breonna-taylor-killing_n_5ebc625fc5b6cdefa7e8fb38&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about Taylor's tragic death&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breonna Taylor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who had &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, literally &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to do with the case the officers were actually investigating. Merciless, her life was taken in the comfort of her own home. We only got a drop of decency from the department who released her partner Kenneth Walker, who was defending himself and Breonna from the officers invading their home. The month before we shed tears over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2020/05/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia-explainer.html&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ahmaud Arbery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who was killed for simply jogging in his own neighborhood while Black. The hate crime went unpunished for nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/2020/05/08/it-took-georgia-officials-2-months-to-arrest-and-charge-father-and-son-with-ahmaud-arberys-murder/&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 full months&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his killers living their lives as if they hadn’t ended someone’s life prematurely just because they could. The white supremacy complex so many people in this country subscribe to must come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager my dad had a close friend who lost his father. His father was a Black Vietnam War Veteran. He fell asleep on his life alert, an honest mistake. When he woke up, he called to let them know what had happened. Dispatch sent word, telling these cops that their services were no longer necessary at the scene. These white cops did not listen. They took matters into their own hands. After exchanging harsh words with our Veteran, who rightfully refused to let them into his home, they called him the n-word with hard r, entered the apartment, and tased and shot him, ultimately ending his life. I say his name, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Kenneth_Chamberlain_Sr&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; title=&quot;Wiki Page on Chamberlain&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleausa.org/report-blasts-review-of-wppd-calls-justification-of-chamberlain-shooting-chilling/&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; title=&quot;Article about the incident&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chamberlain&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/prus-attorney-s-office-closes-investigation-death-kenneth-chamberlain&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; title=&quot;Closing Chamberlain's Investigation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sr.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just as I say the three I mentioned earlier because this senseless killing must stop. Officers must be held accountable. The Police lied on reports, saying Chamberlain was armed, and failed to include the exchange where they called him the n-word. We later got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/westchester-man-killed-cops-not-knife-lawyers-article-1.2850274&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DNA Proof&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Chamberlain was unarmed and after many battles in court got audio released to us, which is how we know the incident was racially charged. In 2012 a Grand Jury decided no criminal charges would be made against these officers. Police brutatlity is law-sanctioned murder. They claim they fear for their lives when in reality they are megalomaniacs who instigate and provoke to justify unecessary use of violence. Mr. Chamberlain’s life was taken from us because of  ignorance, negligence of value for human life, racism and white supremacy. Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. deserves justice. Anthony Carelli and Steven Hart are still free walking around, and most likely still on the force. Carelli was involved in another federal case &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sources-identify-white-plains-anthony-carelli-triggerman-fatal-shooting-retired-marine-article-1.1056394&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot;&gt;3 years earlier&lt;/a&gt; for brutally beating two twin brothers while working on a disordlerly-conduct arrest. Too often these officers who kill people  have a track record. When I still lived in my hometown I went to protests for Mr. Chamberlian, I attended his candle vigil each year held in front of the White Plains Department of Safety, and I went to court battles to show support. I speak up about these issues because I cannot bear to see any more Black lives taken in vain. On top of it all, we are still in the midst of a global pandemic in which Black people are dying at &lt;a href=&quot; https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;three times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the rate of White people. It is no coincidence that this statistic has come about. It is a direct result of institutionalized racism. We have a problem in this country and it needs to be addressed and fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plight for justice has always been something I have cared about. I am biracial, and I know we have a bad rap sometimes because some of us don’t know how to act yet (I’m looking at you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lucky_Shanghai/status/1217664668434604032?s=20)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Beware, this is some clown shit.&quot;&gt;Jeanie Reuter&lt;/a&gt;). I am Black and Chinese. The thing is, I have privilege as a light-skinned person. I am doing my community a disservice if I don’t use it to uplift Black voices— which are too often brushed off, ignored, or crushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not care if you are tired of hearing it: BLACK LIVES MATTER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All lives cannot matter until Black Lives are treated as they truly matter. It is time for change. I am of the belief that this starts with defunding law enforcement. The system that oppresses Black people in this country cannot be reformed. It was not created with them in mind, in fact some argue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/issues/juvenile-justice/school-prison-pipeline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;it was created to keep them oppressed&lt;/a&gt;. We need to start over where everyone is truly equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the end of this post. Below are some resources, threads of petitions, bailout funds, gofundme’s for the names above, threads of protest tips, links to therapist offering services for those who need to talk these traumatic emotions out, and resources for white allies to educate themselves as well. I will continue to add and update this post. Also, if you are feeling particularly generous, the last gofundme is for my Aunt Donna, a disabled Black woman who does not have a permanent home right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello reader, 
I have been social distancing for almost a full month now. I usually stay at my partner’s on weekends and last month after a shift at my part time job they convinced me to stay in. That same night DeBlasio closed restaurants so I was temporarily (I hope?) laid off. My classes have been an adjustment, but I have been doing my best given the circumstances. Part of this week was “Spring Break” so I did get some reprieve from the anxiety and stress it all brings. 
I have finished working on the subscribe function to my website, I want everything to be perfect before I start to promote everything. In the email a peice of code that is hidden on this page, shows up in the email, linking to my blog post. (Hint it’s right under the date, only visible if you mouse over it!) I haven’t gotten the chance to work on comments again, nor the chance to work on making each page responsive to browser window size/ branching to mobile. One step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more personal note, I have been working on my anger, both for my sake and my partner’s. Being stuck inside isn’t an excuse to take my anger out on anyone, but if you read my Self Discovery Journal Prompts 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://niaapps.github.io/niaapps-blog/updates-personal/2019/06/30/self-discovery-journal-prompts.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Journal Prompt post&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; you may recall this is something I have been working on. I think I actually have a 
good handle this time. I just need practice. I feel better about everything this time around. I am equipped with some mental mantras for when I’m in the moment and already had all the post-anger tools like meditation down pact.
I am going to try to learn Chinese (Mandarin, not my family’s tongue Toisanese). I redownloaded an app I used before, but ultimately ended up stopping because I didn’t have time. I have no shortage now. I wish that I could paint, but since I am not home I have no supplies. I have been attempting to motivate myself to work out, but it is not going well. I am reading two books right now. Ryan Holiday’s &lt;em&gt;The Obstacle is the Way&lt;/em&gt; and Steven Forrest’s &lt;em&gt;The Inner Sky&lt;/em&gt;. I think it’s good, one self-help and one for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you doing to keep busy during this social distancing time? Are you keeping hope? I sincerely hope this all passes soon and we all come out safe and ready to reclaim our lives soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending love. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
