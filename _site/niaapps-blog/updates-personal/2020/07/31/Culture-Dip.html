  <h3>Cuture Dip</h3>
  <h3>July 31, 2020</h3>
 <div class="blog-text col-7"><p>Film/Documentraries:</p>

<p>I just finished watching “What happened Miss Simone?” on netflix.
I’ve been watching movies/documentaries that are emotionally moving lately, almost as if
amid all the craziness I need some sort of metaphorical hug. Nina Simone’s life was one of pain,
tragedy, perseverance and an ode to the journey of being true to yourself. I felt it when she spoke about being free, that it meant to live without fear. I often find myself searching for that place, one where I have no fear. She meant this in the context of the Civil Rights Movement, where Black people and people of color can exist without fear because of racism and discrimination. I sincerely hope the strides we make get us to that world.</p>

<p>I watched Kinky Boots on BroadwayHD with a free trial. It was good. I don’t often watch musicals, but something about the flashy outfits and heartfelt song made my bad day better. I watched the version where Lola is played by Matt Henry. In other versions of this Broadway show Lola has been played by Billy Porter and Wayne Brady. There is even a version where Panic at the Disco’s Brendon Urie plays Charlie. The premise is that a family shoe factory is going out of business but is revived by the design of a Drag Queen named Lola and a cobbler Charlie who wants to make better shoes for this “niche market”. I won’t spoil too much, but the scene that stuck out to me was when Lola has a bet with one of the workers to do something that makes them a man. Lola asks Don to “Accept someone for who they are.” Acceptance in my own life is hard for me. I often stride to change people. I cannot change conservatives to be more inclusive, and that is hard for me to accept. I know that people can be better, and it is a bare minimum for me to keep you in my life. I guess in a way I accept that I can’t change them, but instead of subjecting myself to inhumane situations I close my circle. I continue to advocate in my own ways, and hope one day they’ll change.</p>

<p>Disclosure
This one is a must watch. I am apart of the LGBT community because I am a bisexual woman, but that doesn’t mean I know what it is like to be trans. This was a small window into my trans brothers and sisters. Before watching this I’d recently finished the seasons of POSE on Netflix so it was nice to see more vouging as well as MJ Rodriguez speak about her experience. Watching these trans men and women walk us through history with the way they have been depicted was eye-opening. The narratives patriarchy enforces are both harmful to trans people and women.</p>

<p>Books:</p>

<p>Gemini</p>

<p>Becoming</p>

<p>I read Iktomi and the Ducks, and other Sioux stories by Red Bird or Zitkála-Šá, reading a story each night before bed, almost like being a kid again. Quarantine has me comforting myself amid all the craziness, and the stories are sort of meant to be told to children, each carrying a lesson. It was a light hearted read, and although I am not Sioux it was nice to get a slice of insight into indigenous culture. This book was one of the few things I took from my father when we lost our home in 2018. He would gather books from various different North American indigenous cultures. He always wanted to re-connect with our family’s indigenous ancestry, something I also wish to pursue in the future.</p>

<p>The Obstacle is the Way</p>
