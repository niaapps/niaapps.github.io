      <h3>Android Application Outline</h3>
      <p class="tab">For this project I outlined an App that would connect people through events, a cross between MeetUp
        and geo-based Apps. I wrote the outline in pseudo code as well as putting rough drafts of the GUI together. I
        detailed the flow of data and what would be happening both on the front and back end at each stage while
        suggesting ways to achieve the goals through code. Below is client feedback.
