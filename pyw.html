    <h3>Fixing elements on pre-made website.</h3>
    <p class="tab">I was hired by this client to fix an array of issues on her pre-made site. Tasks on this project ranged from fixing broken links to rearranging their site flow to be more efficient, as well as ensuring a plugin was working as desired. Keep in mind I did not design this site, only fixed parts of the site to work as desired. This is the feedback they provided on Upwork.com.

    <p class="tab"> November of 2019 Edit: I have taken pictures down at my client's request. They are pursuing a different field of business and are shutting down the site.</p>
