Hey there!!

I am nearly finished with my lapdesk.

I super glued foam like cut-outs to the back of it and covered with this cute fabric:

And then I also worked on the painting again on the opposite side before I had to get ready for my new internship, which I’ll tell you about in a bit.

I’m thinking I need to clean up the color a little bit and I may add some animal on the right cliff. But rn it already seems to have come together well. I’m really pleased with it.

So as I mentioned before. I actually not only have an internship now but a new job in general. I was unemployed when my last waitressing job was laying people off but now I’m back on track with 2!! The internship is a dream. It’s at this tech company called OpenX and I get to work on a phone app!! Which is exactly what I want to do in the field so it’s Grade A experience. On a personal note, things in my life are just coming together, and I’m ready to put my best foot forward.

Till Next Time!
