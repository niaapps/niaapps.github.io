So I’m working on revamping my website, as I may be doing more HTML work this summer and want to have something to show for it. Below is a gif of my Nav Bar with a hover effect I just finished. The extra space on the left will be for my new logo, which I’m in the process of designing. I know it’s incredibly simple, but it’s 12 am and I’m damn proud. More to come, definitely. What goes on a home page, I am beginning to ask myself. Know any good example sites? Comment them! Have any feedback? Get at me! I’m lonely at this hour.
