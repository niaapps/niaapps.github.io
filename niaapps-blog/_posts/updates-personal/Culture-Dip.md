Hello Reader. As we look upon a better tomorrow with the vaccination rates going up across the country I decided to reflect on some of the things that kept me sane during lockdown. Immersing myself in culture; both ones that I can be a part of and ones I can only appreciate from the outside, was one thing that kept me grounded. If you have not watched or read any of what I talk about today, I suggest you give them a try!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Movies/Documentaries:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   I have not always been into cinema like I am today, but the more I watch, the more I am exposed to the more I fall in love with this specific way of human expression, storytelling, and exposure.

#### _What Happened Miss Simone?_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Last year I watched “What Happened Miss Simone?” on Netflix. I’ve been watching movies/documentaries that are emotionally moving lately, almost as if amid all the craziness I need some sort of metaphorical hug. Nina Simone’s life was one of pain, tragedy, perseverance, and an ode to the journey of being true to yourself. I felt it when she spoke about being free, that it meant to live without fear. I often find myself searching for that place, one where I have no fear. She meant this in the context of the Civil Rights Movement, where Black people and people of color can exist without fear because of racism and discrimination. I sincerely hope the strides we make get us to that world.
 

#### _KinkyBoots_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  I watched Kinky Boots on BroadwayHD with a free trial. It was good. I don’t often watch musicals, but something about the flashy outfits and heartfelt song made my bad day better. I watched the version where Lola is played by Matt Henry. In other versions of this Broadway show, Lola has been played by Billy Porter and Wayne Brady. There is even a version where Panic at the Disco’s Brendon Urie plays Charlie. The premise is that a family shoe factory is going out of business but is revived by the design of a Drag Queen named Lola and a cobbler Charlie who wants to make better shoes for this “niche market”. I won’t spoil too much, but the scene that stuck out to me was when Lola has a bet with one of the workers to do something that makes them a man. Lola asks Don to “Accept someone for who they are.” Acceptance in my own life is hard for me. I often strive to change people. I cannot change conservatives to be more inclusive, and that is hard for me to accept. I know that people can be better, and it is a bare minimum for me to keep you in my life. I guess in a way I accept that I can’t change them, but instead of subjecting myself to inhumane situations, I close my circle. I continue to advocate in my own ways, and hope one day they’ll change.

#### _Disclosure_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   This one is a must-watch. I am a part of the LGBT community because I am a bisexual woman, but that doesn’t mean I know what it is like to be trans. This was a small window into my trans brothers and sisters. Before watching this I’d recently finished the seasons of POSE on Netflix so it was nice to see more voguing, as well as MJ Rodriguez, speak about her experience. Watching these trans men and women walk us through history with the way they have been depicted was eye-opening. The narratives patriarchy enforces are both harmful to trans people and women.

#### _Moonlight_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Moonlight touched my heart. To be a Black and Gay man especially in a southern state like FL is a difficult predicament, and adding poverty into the mix made it so real and relatable to me. This is a coming of age story. This is a story of learning to be who you are. I won't say more than that. It should still be on Netflix and it deserves all the love and praise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Books
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   I have honestly been slacking with reading for pleasure. I will reread fiction in my spare time, but the pandemic has honestly drained that curiosity for something new in me. Here are two new books I have read recently

#### _Gemini: An Extended Autobiographical Statement on My First Twenty-five Years of Being a Black Poet_ by Nikki Giovanni
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Last summer I read Gemini by Nikki Giovanni. For the time her views were radical. She is regarded as a well-renowned poet for works she published after Gemini was released. In this “Extended Autobiographical Statement” she reflects on her first 25 years of life as a Black poet. She details how her writing has changed over time whether the influence is from her upbringing or from venturing into single motherhood. There are obvious serious tones in the book, as she was an integral call for Black power at the time. It should be noted as well there is a dose of homophobia and antisemitism, both widely held ideals for the time amongst the Black community. It struck me because sometimes both of those misguided views can be found in older generations today, but for the most part, we have moved forward. Her writing is witty and she has a keenly unique voice, the unabashedness of putting herself into her work is admirable. I picked this up hoping to find kinship as I am half Black and I am a Gemini, my birthday two days before hers. I also consider myself a budding poet but did not find the connection I was hoping for. Instead, I came to enjoy this book for what it was, a woman’s heart put into words capturing all that was happening around her.

#### _Iktomi and the ducks and other Sioux stories_ by Zitkála-Šá
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   I read Iktomi and the Ducks by Red Bird or Zitkála-Šá, reading a story each night before bed, almost like being a kid again. Quarantine has me comforting myself amid all the craziness, and the stories are sort of meant to be told to children, each carrying a lesson. It was a light-hearted read, and although I am not Sioux it was nice to get a slice of insight into Indigenous culture. This book was one of the few things I took from my father when we lost our home in 2018. He would gather books from various different North American Indigenous cultures. He always wanted to re-connect with our family’s Indigenous ancestry, something I have toiled with doing in the future. Ultimately I’ve learned from Indigenous creators on the internet that reconnection is a very arduous process if you have nothing to go on, and no real claims or access to that culture can be established. This is a result of colonialism and many struggles with disconnectedness. Not all Indigenous people will accept you either calling for blood quantum and whatnot despite the anti-blackness of it all. Alas, the read was a gentle insight into cultures that were forbidden to practice for a long time in this country.
