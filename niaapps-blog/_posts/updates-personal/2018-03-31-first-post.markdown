Thanks for joining me!

Here is my <a href="https://niaapps.github.io/about.html" target="blank" title="About Page">about</a> page.
This is my blog, I am Nia.
This blog is intended to be a halfway between my coding journey and a personal blog.

Hereâ€™s one of my favorite quotes, from my favorite movie:
### "To see with eyes unclouded by hate."
#### ---Hayao Miyazaki, Mononoke Hime
