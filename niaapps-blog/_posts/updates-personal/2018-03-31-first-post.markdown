Thanks for joining me!

Here is my [about](https://niaapps.github.io/about.html) page.
This is my blog, I am Nia.
This blog is intended to be a halfway between my coding journey and a personal blog.

Here’s one of my favorite quotes, from my favorite movie:
### "To see with eyes unclouded by hate."
#### ---Hayao Miyazaki, Mononoke Hime
