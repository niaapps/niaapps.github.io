Hello readers!
Today's post is about how I have been coping with all the craziness of the pandemic, racism, police brutality and overall bad news. In addition to talking with your loved ones and those who you seek out for support, music can also be a form of relief. I listen to music both to come to terms with reality and to feel better. That's how this playlist is set up. I listen to a lot of genres, so this playlist is a mix. It moves through 12 songs from a place of feeling lonely, lost and angry to emotions in between and ending off in a place of hope.

<a href=" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvZucUeG2u9BLKbApChEQR9auxyTKfh_j" target="_blank" title="">Here is the link to the Youtube Playlist </a>

First up we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHhND-BkWdk" target="_blank" title="">All Alone </a>by Gorillaz featuring <a href="http://www.rootsmanuva.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="">Roots Manuva</a>. During this time it can easily feel like you're all alone. Please, text or call your family and friends, you are never really alone, but people cannot read your mind. No one will know you need support if you don't ask for it. This song is rumored to be about Manuva's outlook on the world. The pacing of the beginning builds a feeling of sadness and disappointment. A plea to again be alright.

Next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=votgfrZpq7Q&list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&index=73" target="_blank" title="">Breathe You In</a> by Grace The Enemy. This band's lead is a woman with a delicious scream and a lovely singing voice. The lyrics call out as if you are searching for validation, for redemption:


_"Holding on to this dream we've made_

_I'm less if not crumbling,_

_I know my mind won't be the same_

_As long as we remain undying_

_Breathe you in_

_Overwhelmed, As I_

_Breathe you in_

_Take my hand_

_Show me life as I_

_Breathe you in_

_Breathe you in!"_

It is a call to perseverance, to keep going, to breathe in the good, and to remain undying in your stride. To fight for something higher, something better. I believe that I have needed this advice. When this social distancing began I didn't want to take the situation in. I didn't want to believe I'd be stuck inside for 3+ months. Once I took the situation in it became easier to see the pandemic not as a loss of everything I once knew, but a gain of something new and unexplored.

Then we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBjQ9tuuTJQ&list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&index=69" target="_blank" title="">The Pretender</a> by Foo Fighters. I personally love this song and play it all year round. It gets me hyped up to do anything. The better part of my adult life has felt like a fight. I fight to survive, fight to drag myself out of poverty, fight to keep food on the table and a roof over my own head. Discovering this song a few years ago was very uplifting for me. Whenever I need the push to get back on my feet, I remember the lyrics:

_"What if I say I'm not like the others?_

_What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?_

_You're the pretender_

_What if I say that I'll never surrender?"_

The idea that I'm somehow special, “not like the others” makes me feel empowered. The idea that I'll never surrender, I'll always keep going makes me feel strength. Not falling into the “pretender's” play; that notion is very powerful. To be able to stand in the face of opposition and refusing to bow down. There has been a lot of discourse online about what they meant by pretender. For me personally the pretender is my depression. She wants to lie around all day pretending I can waste away. I pretend when I am depressed that my life isn't worth living, but it always has been and will continue to be. This song gives me the strength to fight another day, to see my worth, and to keep growing.

Segueing into something lighter, next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS6sDhqVROs" target="_blank" title="">Something's Gotta Give</a> by All Time Low. Despite the band's name the music they make can be very relatable and even uplifting. I have felt fed up with the state America is in long before these protests. This song shines a light on feeling like you're at your wit's end. The chorus goes:


_"Wake me up, say enough is enough,_
 
 _I'm dying to live, something's gotta give._ 

 _Pull me out of this sinking town,_ 
 
 _I'm dying to live, something's gotta give!"_

The first lyric is a plea, and I feel like I have been trying to “wake people up” to the truth. When I see those who are misguided it almost feels like they are asking me to enlighten them. They probably aren't, but I can't seem to stop myself from correcting misinformation. I want to wake people up to the truth of the racist system we are governed by. Wake them to the truth of white supremacy that hovers around every corner. Show them the truth that we all live on stolen indigenous land. Too many turn a blind eye to people struggling, but I will no longer blink in the face of ignorance. We are dying to live to our full potential. Black people are _literally_ being killed by both law enforcement and the bias within the system. Something does have to give, something has to change.

I can also relate to this song in the fact that we are all stuck inside from the pandemic, slowly passing the time, wanting something to give with the virus. I truly hope that we are at a new norm by the end of 2020.


The moment you realize generational pain has been being placed on the shoulders of every new generation because not enough changes are being made, you can begin to feel…hopeless.

Next we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgc3_4WL0M" target="_blank" title="">Kiri</a> by Monoral. The Japanese rock band's song was popularized by the grungy anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_Proxy" target="_blank" title="">Ergo Proxy</a>.

_"You complete my fate_

_The world unwinds inside of me_

_You complete my fate_
 
_The halo crawls away_
 
_You repeat my fate_
 
_Rewinding all we can_
 
_You refill my place_
 
_You refill my place, place"_

These lyrics speak to me a lot right now. The notion that history repeats itself, and that we are all completing each other's fate, refilling each other's place. The pattern of getting older and seeing someone younger in your place. It reminds me of <a href="https://twitter.com/aishaoxley/status/1266965056027340800" target="_blank" title="">this video </a>that has been circulating online.

And of course I can't forget the chorus, the pleading echoing line sung 5 times:
 
_"Come and save me."_

The simple prayer of finding reprieve, redemption, for all the suffering to birth something worthwhile. 


Now we transition from that hopelessness to somewhere still sad but more level with the situation.

Next up is another throwback <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XleOkGsYgO8&list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&index=7" target="_blank" title="">Move Along</a> by All American Rejects. "Move Along" is some of the best advice I have received. Sometimes it's easy to succumb to our emotions, or the way we feel about situations in our lives. If you shorten transition time (idea I read from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12138871-18-minutes" target="_blank" title="">Peter Bergman</a>) and choose to look forward and keep going it will be easier to get through your day to day. As the song says: 

_"Speak to me!_

_When all you got to keep is strong_

_Move along, move along like I know you do_

_And even when your hope is gone_

_Move along, move along just to make it through_

_Move along_

_Move along"_

Sometimes all you have is movement, moving into the next moment. I try to make it better than the last, the small steps add up to a significant recognizable change.

Next up is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_O_T6Aq85E&list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&index=44&t=0s" target="_blank" title="">Snap Out Of It</a> by The Arctic Monkeys. Too often I find myself stuck in a rut. Now that all this extra time is available to us it can be so easy to fall victim to spending a significant amount of time on our phones, or on social media. Many times a week I will find I am glued to facebook or twitter. I feel the pressing need to stay in the know. To be aware of the state of this country given all the protests and police brutality people are rallying against. Sometimes you need to snap out of it for your own mental health. Remember to draw the line for your own well being, because if you don't you _will_ burn yourself out and we need everyone at their best right now. The best you possibly can be.

We have gotten past the anger, we have gotten past the shock of the current moment, we have snapped out of it. Now we want to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw-GdthJGuo&list=PLvZucUeG2u9BLKbApChEQR9auxyTKfh_j&index=7&t=0s" target="_blank" title="">Rise Again</a>. This song is by Equilibrium, one of the most uplifting metal folk bands I've ever stumbled upon. This song came from my "Hype" playlist. Once you are past all your low-vibrational emotions, you need something to help you pick yourself back up. As the lyrics go:

_"Let's get forward, no time to rest_

_It doesn't really matter if east or west_

_So many roads are unexplored_

_The journey is its own reward_

_I feel it inside_

_My eyes are open wide_

_My heart will acclaim_

_The sun will rise again"_

This song is all about living to see another day and cherishing the moment. Garnering the courage to seize that moment and truly appreciating it. No matter where in your journey it happens to be you can appreciate it for what it is. It's about finding the drive to pick yourself up as you move and act with intention. During this time inside it has been hard to stay productive at times. It’s okay if you stray, but coming back and rising again is crucial to making progress.

Next in line is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUmV-MorIKc&list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&index=30" target="_blank" title="">Patience</a> by Tame Impala. The hypnotizing chorus, (and I say hypnotizing because that's how all their songs make me feel) :

_"Just growin' up in stages_

_(Lay down, low down)_

_Livin' life in phases_

_Another season changes_

_And still my days are shapeless"_

When quarantine began, the weather was still chilly. I still had to wear the lighter of my two winter coats. We have seen the change of the end of winter, to spring and now we have the summer solstice coming up on June 21st. I still had structure from school, but once the semester ended I have been feeling my days are a bit shapeless. To be fair to myself, this website was only 50% done when quarantine began, and now I am writing to you daily on this blog. Patience is also a virtue I have been struggling with, but am trying to have more with myself and others. I have been doing a ton of self discovery during this time, which is why the first and third lyrics resonate with me deeply. I’m taking things one day at a time, but cannot deny the transition I’ve been going through. The same can be said about the political unrest we are seeing in the air. All the anger and trauma are being transmuted into malleable changes. Police Departments across the country are having resources rerouted back into communities.

The embodiment of this next song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoS9rEfHKwo&list=RDEMlDgR2N2D5vOyaWLoYcMwdw&index=8" target="_blank" title="">Everybody's Something</a> by Chance the Rapper feat. Saba and BJ The Chicago Kid, is that no one's life is nothing. Everybody is someone to somebody. Chance is an outspoken man of faith and he does right by it in this song. The bridge and chorus goes: 

_Nice to see you Father New Year_

_Middle finger Uncle Samuel_

_Shooting death with weighted dice_

_And hitting stains on birthday candles_

_I know somebody, somebody loves my ass_

_Cause they help me beat my demons ass_

_Everybody's somebody's everything_

_I know you right_

_Nobody's nothing_

_That's right_

The first two lines are said to be Chance acknowledging the beauty of seeing another year, but flipping off Uncle Sam is a criticism of our government. Chance has not been all talk, he has put an enormous amount of his resources back into Chicago’s community and government. The next two lines are debated about whether he means death is weighting the dice in its favor for Chicago’s youth. Or if the youth are weighting them escaping death another year. In addition echoing back to what I was saying with The Pretender and depression, this is looking at it from the other side. “Cause they help me beat my demon’s ass”. No one should have to fight their demons alone. You matter to someone; at the very least one person in your life, even if that person happens to be yourself, or someone you haven’t even met yet.

Nearing the end, we come to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSivlaSVk1k&list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&index=17" target="_blank" title="">We Got The Power</a> by Gorillaz. I was trying to not repeat artists on this playlist, but this song is exactly what this playlist needs. At the end of the day through all the terrible things happening in the world, we have power. The chorus goes:

_"We got the power to be loving each other, no matter what happens_

_We've got the power to do that_

_On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?_

_We got the power to be ringing the great bell out there above us_

_We got the power for that_

_We got the power to do that"_

We as humans can choose to feel unity. The lyric in French sung by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehnny_Beth" target="_blank" title="">Jehnny Beth</a> translates to "We have the power to love one another, okay?" I urge you reader, when it is safe to go out once again, get to know your community. Your neighbors, the local shop owners, the people in your immediate area. You are even more fortunate if your town has a community center, check out local events. We see these racists online and ask how they can be so hateful and ignorant. It is because they aren't exposed to people who don't look like them. They make assumptions and don't fact check their news. They follow an orange menace who spews hate, bigotry, xenophobia and much more. Spending time with people in your community is a great way to make friends and feel empathy for others. We have always had the power to keep loving each other. Be the example you want to see in the world. 

Lastly, we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzQWCeguH30" target="_blank" title="">Crystal Clear</a> by Hayley Williams. This song is fairly new, it is about seeing things as they truly are and as Williams says in the echoing chorus, much like a mantra:

_"Crystal Clear, I won't give into the fear."_

In these troubling times it is important to look at the situation without fear, but rather objectivity. Giving into fear will only make your decisions erratic and possibly dangerous. Seeing things in new light can be incredibly liberating. The second I started looking at quarantine as a detriment I lost all power in the situation. I now see this just is, and I need to make the best of it and have been attempting to do so.

Thank you for reading, let me know what songs you are using to cope with in the comments below!
Lastly I found this artist while searching for songs, while I don't know any of them well enough to put them on this playlist, Yves Tumor, an upcoming Black Non-Binary artist deserves your time, so please lend your ear:

<a href="https://youtu.be/N0c7lVHMyaY" target="_blank" title="">Kerosene!</a>

<a href="https://youtu.be/LJ4o9ppV4yg" target="_blank" title="">Romanticist/Dream Palette</a>


 See you next time and stay safe!
