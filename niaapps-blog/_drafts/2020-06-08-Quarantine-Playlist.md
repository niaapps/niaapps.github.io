Hello readers!
Today's post is about how I have been coping with all the craziness of the pandemic, racism, police brutality and overall bad news. In addition to talking with your loved ones and those you seek out for support, music can also be a form of relief. I listen to music both to come to terms with reality and to feel better. That's how this playlist is set up. It moves through 10 songs from a place of anger to emotions in between to a place of hope.


First up we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHhND-BkWdk" target="_blank" title="">All Alone </a>by Gorillaz featuring <a href="http://www.rootsmanuva.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="">Roots Manuva</a>. During this time it can easily feel like you're all alone. Please, text or call your family and friends, you are never really alone, but people cannot read your mind. No one will know you need support if you don't ask for it. This song is rumored to be about Manuva's outlook on the world. The pacing of the beginning really makes you feel the sadness, the dissapointment the plea to again be alright.  

Next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=votgfrZpq7Q&list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&index=73" target="_blank" title="">Breathe You In</a> by Grace The Enemy. This band's lead is a woman with a delicious scream and a lovely singing voice. The lyrics call out as if you are searching for validation, for redemption:


_"Holding on to this dream we've made_

_I'm less if not crumbling,_

_I know my mind won't be the same_

_As long as we remain undying_

_Breathe you in_

_Overwhelmed, As I_

_Breathe you in_

_Take my hand_

_Show me life as I_

_Breathe you in_

_Breathe you in!"_

It is a call to perseverance, to keep going. To breathe in the good, and to remain undying in your stride, in your fight for something higher, something better.

Then we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBjQ9tuuTJQ&list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&index=69" target="_blank" title="">The Pretender</a> by Foo Fighters. I personally love this song and play it all year round. It gets me hyped up to do anything. The better part of my adult life has felt like a fight. Fighting to survive, fighting to drag myself out of poverty, fighting to keep food on the table and a roof over my own head. Finding this song a few years ago was very uplifting, whenever I need the push to get back on my feet, I remember the lyrics: 

_What if I say I'm not like the others?_

_What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?_

_You're the pretender_

_What if I say that I'll never surrender?"_

The idea that I'm somehow special, "not like the others". The idea that I'll never surrender, I'll always keep going. Not falling into the "pretender's" play. That notion is very powerful, standing in the face of opposition and refusing to bow down. There has been a lot of discourse online about what they meant by pretender. For me personally, the pretender is my depression. She wants to lie around all day pretending I can waste away. I pretend when I am depressed that my life isn't worth living, but it always has been and will continue to be. This song gives me the stength to fight another day, to see my worth, and to keep growing.

Segueing into something lighter, next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS6sDhqVROs" target="_blank" title="">Something's Gotta Give</a> by All Time Low. Despite the bands name the music they make can be very relatable and even uplifting. I have been fed up with the state America is in. In the context of the struggle the Black community is facing the lyrics fit perfectly:


_"Wake me up, say enough is enough,_
 
 _I'm dying to live, something's gotta give._ 

 _Pull me out of this sinking town,_ 
 
 _I'm dying to live, something's gotta give!"_

 The first lyric is a plea, and I feel like I have been trying to "wake people up" to the truth. When I see those who are misguided it almost feels like they are asking me to enlighten them. They probably aren't, but I can't seem to stop myself from correcting misinformation. I want to wake people up to the truth of the racist system we are governed by, the truth of white supremacy around every corner, the truth that we all live on stolen indigenous land. Too many turn a blind eye to people struggling, but I will no longer blink in the face of ignorance. We are dying to live to our full potential; literally being killed by both law enforcement and the bias within the system and something does have to give, something has to change. 

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgc3_4WL0M" target="_blank" title="">Kiri</a> by Monoral.

Next is another throwback <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XleOkGsYgO8&list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&index=7" target="_blank" title="">Move Along</a> by All American Rejects. "Move Along" is some of the best advice I have recieved. Sometimes it's easy to succumb to our emotions, or the way we feel about situations in our lives. If you shorten transition time (idea I read from Peter Bergman) and choose to look forward and keep going it will be easier to get through your day to day. As the song says: 

_"Speak to me!_

_When all you got to keep is strong_

_Move along, move along like I know you do_

_And even when your hope is gone_

_Move along, move along just to make it through_

_Move along_

_Move along"_

Sometimes all you have is movement, moving into the next moment. I try to make it better than the last, the small steps add up to a significant recognizable change.

We have gotten past the anger, we have gotten past the shock of the current moment. Now we want to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw-GdthJGuo&list=PLvZucUeG2u9BLKbApChEQR9auxyTKfh_j&index=7&t=0s" target="_blank" title="">Rise Again</a>. This song is by Equilibrium, one of the most uplifting metal folk bands I've ever stumbled upon. This song came from my "Hype" playlist. Once you are past all your low-vibrational emotions, you need something to help you pick yourself back up. As the lyrics go:

_"Let's get forward, no time to rest_

_It doesn't really matter if east or west_

_So many roads are unexplored_

_The journey is its own reward_

_I feel it inside_

_My eyes are open wide_

_My heart will acclaim_

_The sun will rise again"_

Next up is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_O_T6Aq85E&list=PLvZucUeG2u9ASHfb6woB3RvE6Mn-uK36z&index=44&t=0s" target="_blank" title="">Snap Out Of It</a> by The Arctic Monkeys. Too often I find myself stuck in a rut. Now that all this extra time is available to us it can be so easy to fall victim to spending a significant amount of times on our phones, or on social media. Many times a week I will find I am glued to facebook and twitter needing to stay in the know of the state of this country given all the protests and police brutality they are rallying against. Sometimes you need to snap out of it for your own mental health. Remember to draw the line for your own well being. 


Nearing the end, we come to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUmV-MorIKc&list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&index=30" target="_blank" title="">Patience</a> by Tame Impala.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoS9rEfHKwo&list=RDEMlDgR2N2D5vOyaWLoYcMwdw&index=8" target="_blank" title="">Everybody's Something</a> by Chance the Rapper feat. Saba and BJ The Chicago Kid. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSivlaSVk1k&list=PLvZucUeG2u9D5EwEgVTFEpfpgK4FOaaTo&index=17" target="_blank" title="">We Got The Power</a> by Gorillaz. I was trying really hard to not repeat artists on this playlist, but this song is exactly what this playlist needs. At the end of the day through all the terrible things happening in the world, we have power. The chorus goes:

_"We got the power to be loving each other, no matter what happens_

_We've got the power to do that_

_On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?_

_We got the power to be ringing the great bell out there above us_

_We got the power for that_

_We got the power to do that"_

We as humans can choose to feel unity. The lyric in French sung by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehnny_Beth" target="_blank" title="">Jehnny Beth</a> translates to "We have the power to love one another, okay?" I urge you reader, when it is safe to go out once again, get to know your community. Your neighbors, the local shop owners, the people in your immediate area. You are even more fortunate if your town has a community center, check out local events. We see these racists online and ask how they can be so hateful and ignorant. It is because they aren't exposed to people who don't look like them. They make assumptions and don't fact check their news. They follow an orange menace who spews hate, bigotry, xenophobia and much more. Spending time with people in your community is a great way to make friends and feel empathy for others. We have always had the power to keep loving each other. Be the example you want to see in the world. 

Lastly we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzQWCeguH30" target="_blank" title="">Crystal Clear</a> by Hayley Williams. This one is fairly new, it is about seeing things as they truly are and as Williams says in the echoing chorus, much like a mantra: 

_"Crystal Clear, I won't give into the fear."_

 In these scary, troubling times it is important to look at the situation without fear, but rather objectivity. Giving into fear will only make your decisions erractic and possibly dangerous. Seeing things in new light can be incredibly liberating. The second I started looking at Quarantine as a detriment I lost all power in the situation. I now see this just is, and I need to make the best of it and have been attempting to do so.
