<!-- This topic is especially important for the tough times we are living in. The other day I listened to a podcast called The Overdose Epidemic. The episode was about how a woman Imani, a victim of addiction who lost the in-person community and support she needed when lockdown was happening and how it took not only her life but many others lives as well.  From the podcast, the online experience just was not the same for many and as mentioned before being stuck inside only exacerbated this already tough transition period. Asking for help would potentially have saved them. Imani's mother has started an organization called Imani's Safehouse that aims to aid people like Imani facing mental health issues perpetuated by the racist patriarchal system we live in.  They do so by providing housing and other resources. I recently donated and would appreciate anyone who wants to match me. You can donate <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=6Q2LABFG7DG34" target="_blank" title="Donate to Imani's safehouse">here.</a> You can listen to the podcast <a href="https://www.justhumanproductions.org/podcasts/epidemic/season-1-epidemic/s1e58-an-overdose-epidemic-deaths-of-despair-part-i-sandra-lindie-will-cooke-jennifer-fecu" target="_blank" title="">here.</a>  -->
