<!-- This topic is especially important for the tough times we are living in. The other day I listened to a podcast called The Overdose Epidemic. The episode was about how a woman Imani, a victim of addiction who lost the in-person community and support she needed when lockdown was happening and how it took not only her life but many others lives as well.  From the podcast, the online experience just was not the same for many and as mentioned before being stuck inside only exacerbated this already tough transition period. Asking for help would potentially have saved them. Imani's mother has started an organization called Imani's Safehouse that aims to aid people like Imani facing mental health issues perpetuated by the racist patriarchal system we live in.  They do so by providing housing and other resources. I recently donated and would appreciate anyone who wants to match me.

My childhood home is a place with both wonderful memories and heartbreak. We eventually lost our house to a bank in a years long court battle that was complicated for many reasons. I often reflect on the memories of that house, good and bad. I have many mixed feelings about the place, because I know it was both my grandfather's and grandmother's intention that I or one of my siblings would inherit the house. That it would stay in our family. I won't get into the complicated reasons, but the situation serves as a reminder to me: not all skin folk are kin folk and capitalism, greed and manipulation will rear their ugly heads sooner or later.-->
