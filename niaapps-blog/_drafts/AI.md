AI is replacing some things. I think this can be both good and bad.

Here is my take. It can take time for new things to integrate into our society. AI is no differet. There are pros and cons. Our legal systems worldwide are still accomodating all the new changes, navigating and attempting to assert guardrails. The fact of the matter is capitalism is a hellscape and people need to eat. AI taking jobs away is a *real* possibility.

Take [come up with an easy example anypne can understand.] for example.

 Automation in our current system can simplify and replace certain jobs. Under our current socioeconomic system, people in such industries will not survive if AI keeps going in the direction it's moving. If [companies] were making this change with supporting communities in mind, I see AI being widely accepted. If we move away from this fast-paced lifestyle, I see AI as a tool that can improve all of our lives.
Imagine for a moment:
> A country commissons and provides data to an AI model that is trained to calculate how much water, nutrient-rich or dense soil, sunlight is needed to provide a community with food on a yearly basis. Taking the weather data from the last 10 years into account, it formulates a plan of what to grow when. We then find these condiitions and over a few years attempt to work out the kinks - making something like this sustainable in the real world. 

Of course, there are things AI can't do - the actual planting and harvesting, preparing these crops for natural disasters due to climate change, and more -- but you can imagine how this powerful tool can be used to benefit the masses.
Unfortunately, this feels like a pipe dream - money will always be the focus of the rich.

We also have cons around intellectual property. Generative AI has been used to steal art from artists. It's as simple as feeding midjourney instagram photos of from your favorite artist and prompting it to generate something based on the references. It's not perfect, but it gets better with time. I personally do not believe that AI art carries the same prose, emotion and weight that art made by artists does. I think there is something inherently human that AI cannot reproduce. But that doesn't stop people who do not hold that value from stealing from artists or devaluing their work. [This really works me up. Imagine spending your life perfecting your craft and someone rips off your art with AI and then makes merch of it.] An as mentioned [need to check] in a <link> previous AI post - facial recognition AI continues to fail us in 2023 [article of black woman who was arrested in front of her kids] AI can have a place in our society, but these aformentioned cons only really scratch the surface. If this is something you'd like me to contiue to write about, I can -- but I intebtioanlly included main bad points to not depress us too much.

### The bright side
AI has real world opportunity to simplify the way we operate in our daily lives. In addition to my wishful example in the last section, AI does have more realistic potential pros.
