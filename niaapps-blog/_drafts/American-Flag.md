Hello Reader. 

I hope this finds you well. 

I've been ruminating a lot lately, and here are some conclusions I'm making.


I moved at the end of last year. One thing that was in my video chat background a lot was this beach umbrella with the american flag on it that I bought one summer in July. Out of fear and embarrassment I would often blur my zooms. These past 180+ days I've spent a lot of time reflecting on safety, as an american, as well as the security I (do and do not) feel, and how in first-world countries many take so much for granted in comparison to the conditions Palestinians, the Sudanese and Congolese are facing right now. 

I have been evaluating what being an american means to me. I used to feel a sense of pride and belonging that I found through my queer identity. It's true, we are very accepting of the gays here in the US. It's a privilege on the world stage. Yet, not everywhere in this "united" nation can accept our existence. Land of the free has never really meant free, but I would perceive my american-ness on the premise of "but we could become free". There was value in that hope. I still hold it. But we won't unite on how sickening I can look in an outfit, or 

Dream filled? With certainty. 


## Not the individual's fault, by design
There is so much greed at play.
From billionaire to angry millennials who are now low-income because they'd been misled about what the workforce would actually be like. Trickle-down economics has always been a lie, but trickle down greed is evident to me. 

A billionaire steals a wage (through exploitation if that was not obvious). His(statistically a man, but no I'm not going to use gender inclusive language here because billionaires shouldn't exist while other humans on this forsaken space rock go hungry, please go touch grass) assistant acts greedy at her weekly nail appointment, entitled to champagne, and a nail tech's time, energy and emotions. The nail tech is greedy with their money, because at the bottom of a food chain, there are some slim pickings, but nonetheless she prioritizes herself consistently instead of her tweens at home. 



Israel continues to be the initial, primary, and often times ONLY aggressor when interacting with other nation-states.

Do you know how bad it is for a government of a nation state to use food, specifically lack thereof and lack of water as weapons against an ethnic people? 







Your stance on Genocide in Palestine, has become a decisive equalizer. I am both thrilled and unthrilled at this. Don't forget about the Congolese who are facing their own genocide, the Indigenous people in all occupied territories of america, including the land you are on right now~ (I live on Munsee Lenape land and without action this acknowlegment means little. ), the Sudanese in

Transformative justice is meant for people, not governing bodies of politicians. Not nation states. I sit for the national anthem and would sit for the pledge in school.
