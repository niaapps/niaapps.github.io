Hello Readers!

Today's post is something I've been wanting to right for a while. I have been working on my inner voice a lot, how I speak to myself. With my upbringing this voice used to be very negative, mean, and insulting. I have realized over time that things shouted at me as a child from my abuser became my normal internal monologue over time. Changing the way I speak to myself has been really freeing. When I mess up or have a moment that I need to grow in, I can now say I often opt to treat myself with grace, patience and understanding. Being mean to myself does not serve me in any way. It does not make the situation better, and it does not make me feel better. So I simply don't do it anymore. But how was able to change this behavior? That's what we'll jump into now :)
