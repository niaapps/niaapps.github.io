Hello Readers!
If you follow me on instagram, some of this post might feel like a repeat. I do highlight things that did not make it onto the platform so there is some new stuff so keep reading!

This month I have been highlighting Black History, most of which I was not taught in school, but either at home from family or discovering on my own. Speaking of family, I want to start this post off by honoring some family who made history in their own ways.

My grandfather is someone I did not get to know because he passed before I was born. I have been told he was a great musician and music teacher. A writer in his spare time and a kind husband to my grandmother whom I did get to know.

Clarence _ Williams.
