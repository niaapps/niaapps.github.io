Hey readers!
Today I will be going over 5 skills every developer or programmer should hone. These skills will help you navigate the tech industry with ease for a better career. These are my top 5 from my 8 years of coding experience.

## Data structures

Developing your ability to work with even the most basic data structures is crucial. From HashTables to Graphs, creative and complex solutions only happen with complex structures. DS is something that becomes easier over time with practice. For those who are new a data structure is a specific format for organizing, storing and retrieving data. In Java we have Arrays, LinkedLists trees and more. Each data structure behaves in it's own way so it is important to practice with them all. I'm sure the first time you used a 2D array it felt daunting. As you use these structures more, for work or for practice you will become comfortable in this skill. In the event that you don't there are resources like <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?search=data+structures&sort=ASCENDING&order=DIFFICULTY" target="_blank" title="LeetCode data structures problems">LeetCode</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/" target="_blank" title="Geeks for Geeks Data Structures">Geeks for Geeks</a> that can help you practice or solidify your understanding in addition to Skillshare classes and textbooks.

## Version Control

I've written <a href="https://niaapps.github.io/niaapps-blog/updates-coding/2021/05/26/CUNY-Hackathon.html" target="_blank" title="CUNY Hackathon Post">previously</a> about how I love hackathons because they give me the opportunity to work in groups and learn specific team-related skills, one being version control. Version Control is a way for different people (usually on a team) to work on the same project and control what code is "final" and what code is in the works. If you did not use VC and someone adds changes that makes everything break, you're creating extra work for yourselves. Another pro is that if someone does accidentally push a change to a main branch that is causing issues, you can view the version history, and use a command like git revert to straighten out the issue.

## One of each type of language

## Patience

Patience will carry you through when all else fails. If there is a problem with your code that is driving you crazy the best thing you can do is take a step back. I and others have said it before: sometimes staring at your spotty code for hours and trying to trial and error it into working just won't work. Take the time to clear your mind and come back fresh to develop a new algorithm or expand the one you are working on in a new way. Being patient with yourself and your work will do wonders for your mental health and productivity!
