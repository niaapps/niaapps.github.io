Hey Readers! After asking for some feedback on what you want to learn more about I got two replies asking to delve more into Cryptocurrency. 


### Blockchain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To understand cryptocurrency you first have to understand what a Blockchain is. In simplest terms it is a system that holds information. These blocks of info are secure because of their decentralized nature, meaning no one corporation, government or authority has control over the information. These accesible digitized blocks are all linked together. Once a block is accepted on the chain it cannot be augumented or deleted. No one can contest that that information doesn't exist or that in the case of crypto a transaction was not made. Blockchain isn't only for cryptocurrency, for example <a href="https://youtu.be/CsxjlsBYmrI" target="_blank" title="">MedicalChain</a> uses the blockchain to securely help patients interact with doctors, health insurance companies and pharmacies. 

### Back to Crypto
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most cryptocurrencies operate on a Blockchain, the same security doesn't exist without it. Let's take Bitcoin for example, being it was a pioneer of Cryptocurrency in general. When you are on the Blockchain you have a digital identifier. This ID comes in two parts a Private or Secret Key and a Public Key. If you were to send me one BTC a couple of things would happen.

First
 My ID for *that* transaction would be calculated based on the tansaction and my secret key that no one else has access to. Then more code comes in taking this ID and my public key to verify that it was created with my secret key and not by anyone else. If this verification is true then this ID This is attacched to our transcational block to represnt that I on the recieving end approve this transaction. Then it is added to the Blockchain for the entire world to see. Every transcation that is made has a new, different ID or signature based on the transaction and your secret key. Usually these signatures are arounf 256 bits and for the most part use <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10087/what-is-the-meaning-of-trapdoor-in-cryptography" target="_blank" title="An explanation on Trapdoor functions">Trapdoor functions</a> to calculate these keys. Trapdoor functions are easy to calculate one way but extremely difficult to go backwards from if you are missing some information, in this case your secret key. 


Any coin that isn't Bitcoin (the first cryptocurrency) is referred to as an Alt-Coin. Some common ones are Ethereum, LiteCoin and most recently Dogecoin.
