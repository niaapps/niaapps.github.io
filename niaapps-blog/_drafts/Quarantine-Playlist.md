Hello readers!
Today's post is about how I have been coping with all the craziness of the pandemic, racism, police brutality and overall bad news. In addition to talking with your loved ones and those you seek out for support, music can also be a form of relief. I listen to music both to come to terms with reality and to feel better. That's how this playlist is set up. It moves from a place of anger to  emotions in between to a place of hope.

This one is fairly new, it is about seeing things as they truly are and as Williams says "I won't give into the fear." In these scary, troubling times it is important to look at the situation without fear, but rather objectivity. Giving into fear will only make your decisions erractic and possibly dangerous.
