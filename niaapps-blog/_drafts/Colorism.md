Hey Peou! I hope you have been doing well since the last time I saw you, and amidst all the craziness of the world right now. I am reaching out because I am writing a blog post on Colorism. I was planning to quote one of your poems from Khmer Girl, "Bleaching My Skin". I am writing both to ask your permission and to see if you had anything to say about the topic/your experience with Colorism. I am interested in the parallels between your experience as a darker skinned Asian person to darker skinned Black people. I have been seeing conversations online about it a lot and wanted to delve deeper, I plan to write about how Colorism hurts melanated people and in a way gives lighter toned people a bit of privilege. It is my belief that it is a self hatred and the societal hatred of darker skin that becomes internalized in our communities. If you have any insight about why you think it is so prevalent, what drove you to feel the need to bleach your skin, what you think the answer or solution to this issue is(I am of the belief it is self love as well as normalizing dark skin through representation, many feel lighter skinned people act superior because of their tone.The only solution I can think of is educating about why dark skin is seen as undesirable when it is something people have no control over.) I would love to hear your thoughts and quote you in my post if you are willing.
