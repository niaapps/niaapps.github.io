Hey readers! Today I am writing about a topic that everyone should care about. If you use the internet or social media daily, this one is for you! 
<div class="mouse-over">(Don't we all?)</div>

Have you ever been on social media, minding your business, when suddenly an ad that is just little **_too_** personal pops up on your feed? 

{insert reel}

It is not fun! It feels like someone is watching over your shoulder. So today I am going to answer the question: _"Why and how does this happen?"_

Internet privacy is how much of your personal information remains private when you are on the internet. This can include financial information, browsing history, and personal preferences. Internet privacy can also be referred to as digital privacy or online privacy. 

We are constantly sharing data about ourselves on platforms we use. Google uses your birthday when you sign up for Gmail to make sure you get age-appropiate ads. When you like a photo on Instagram it will suggest similar ads containing products connected to it. When you visit a website you are sharing data: your location through IP, your habits (how long you spend on a page, what you click on etc.). Similarly, search engines collect both of these in addition to search history and cookies.

Companies collect this data and create a "profile" on all of to give them an idea on our preferences from social media to browsing, from shopping to political stances. Sometimes this data is sold to third parties, and sometimes it is used directly by the company, for say targeted ads. 

### The "How"
There are some misconceptions about the "how". Companies cannot listen to you through your phone and then give you an ad for the thing you verbally said (The government is a different story, but I'll save that for another post.). Nonetheless, it feels _this_ invasive when a targeted ad is shown. 

Let's go over an example and breakdown each step. Pretend you are shopping for a reusable water bottle. 
>You go to a retail website like Walmart.com or Amazon.com and a cookie is created associated with your computer.
>When you visit an article the next day. The article's website reads your cookie data, and you start to get ads related to the cookie, say, fitness equipment.
>This paired with your search engine history, social media likes and dislikes and more help ads become more and more targeted. 
>It is multi-platformed too, if different sites or apps are using the same ad provider, for ex, Google's Ad sense. If you go on 5 different apps that all use the same ad provider you are likely to get ads from the same company, as the provider is drawing from the same pool of information each time. 

Your internet browser, search engines and websites all store this information for as long as you let them, so be sure to clear your cookies and data when you need to. The downside to this is having to sign in manually, as the same data, like a saved user-name or password is also stored this way. Targeted ads that feel way too personal are the culmination of websites having a large amount of information on you. The right to be forgotten, or the right to internet privacy is something we should all care about especially after April 2017 when Trump signed into law a measure that <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/status-internet-privacy-legislation-state" target="_blank" title="ACLU article about Internet privacy">allows ISPs to </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-signs-measure-let-isps-sell-your-data-without-consent-n742316" target="_blank" title="NBC article about Trump's ISP measure">sell your data without consent.</a>
