-the binary is limiting but gender itself can be expansive.
Hello reader.

I've been wanting to write, to share and to contextualize this part of me on my blog for so long. Life got really busy around the time I finally worked up the courage to come out a second time, updating my pronouns and being intentional with aligning myself with specific words or a label.
If you know me in real life, or just follow my socials, you might know that I came out as transgender non-binary over a year ago in April. I've updated my pronouns from she/they to they/them/theirs.

I felt this change was necessary for a number of reasons... If you don't care to know, or are simply at a point with your gender-identity education where you cannot hear this-- that's 100% valid. Bookmark it for when you are, because this post is everything I wish I knew, or wish someone had challenged and told me regarding the gender binary. So with an introduction out the way, let's break it down.


### What is non-binary?
A generalized term, sometimes referred to an "umbrella" term as its reach is broad. A person who is non-binary feels they do not align exclusively with "woman" or "man" gender identities. Not to be confused with assigned sex at birth(which I'll delve into later), sex and gender are two separate concepts. It's 2023. You should know that. Congratulations if you've just learned such! (genuinely, I'm excited about your gender studies as a fellow scholar.) When I say "aligned" I mean to say the (expected) behaviors, perception and overall vibe or energy these genders encompass. In our society we assign so much binary perception to everyday objects. Do you understand what I mean? Here's an example.



### The construct of gender harms cis men and women just as much as it does trans people. 
Women are tired of being viewed as objects.

Men aren't less for having emotions. In fact, *"real"* men are in touch with their own emotions. 
Men can be dainty, skinny, fit, comfy. Men can be fat, angry, childish. But the world still turns. Everyone around you recognizes a pattern. What aren't I seeing?

### How did I decide?
I've always opted for gender-neutral language just because I want to be inclusive and respectful, plus, in most cases it's simplifies the sentence I'm trying to say. You can see this even as I address you, I always say, "Hello Reader". When you talk of someone whose gender you don't explicitly know you already use singular they/them or non gendered terms. But nonetheless. I know many will take their time with this change for any non-binary person in their lives. 

Those who were respectful before this change would use they/them, but for the most part I was referred to & perceived as a woman. 

After a very wholesome <a href="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14292407/pexels-photo-14292407.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2" target="_blank" title="You know the kind ;) [alt: psilocybe cubensis the fungi]">trip</a> and an honest conversation with my partner I kept pushing the feeling of unfit puzzle piece down for nearly two years. 

I find the binary extremely limiting. 

### The Ugly
I get misgendered a lot. One reason I was so reluctant to socially transition was anger. It does make me angry to be misgendered. I don't want to be seen as a man or a woman. I just want to be seen as a person. As the lovely, fun, kind, ambitious person that I am. Being misgendered makes me frustrated. It means my perceived gender expression is not matching up with my gender identity and I don't know what I'm doing wrong.(Spoiler alert, I can't be doing anything wrong because society's ingrained perceptions are not solely *my* responsibility) I know in part it's not my doing, but instead societally held ideas [August's article] like androgyny being inherently masc leaning are at play. But I wonder if the world will ever be ready for trans people who don't medically transition. To this point -- I try my best to break out of the "I can only present andro/masc because I am born female and the world does not accept non-binary people who are not andro." It's hard, no doubt. I can wear a skirt and be non-binary. AMAB non binray people do it all the time. Clothes do not have gender. I can go days where I do not bind my chest -- it does not mean I am suddenly not outside the binary. Biology is not a determinant of somebody's gender. Gender is unique to every human soul on this Earth. Have you ever stopped to ask yourself what it means to be the gender you are? <tiktok vid>

If it's not the clothes, the expected behaviors, or the biology what is it? I am a lot, and I mean A LOT of the expected behaviors and archetypes we expect of men -- but I am not a man. I do not identify with what society percieves as cis men. That experience is simply not mine, nor do I want it. I did not feel comfortable being referred to as a woman. I did not like being percieved as the angry {black, for the racists who knew I was biracial} woman, when in reality I am just assertive and a no-nonsense, no bullshit person. I can be aggressive. It doesn't make aggressive women out there not women, and it doesn't make me a man. But the expectations being placed on me in my experience before I came out really pushed me to challenge how I view gender and myself.


### Better Language = A more inclusive circle, space, world

Touch on the idea that being non-binary is decolonized identity, other cultures often have a third+ genders, Muxes, 2S etc hjira
